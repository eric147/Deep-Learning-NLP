8267190,Epidural clonidine treatment for refractory reflex sympathetic dystrophy.,"Rauck RL, Eisenach JC, Jackson K, Young LD, Southern J",Anesthesiology. 1993 Dec;79(6):1163-9; discussion 27A.,"BACKGROUND: Intraspinally administered alpha 2-adrenergic agonists may relieve pain in sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) syndromes, such as reflex sympathetically dystrophy (RSD), by spinal, peripheral, and central nervous system actions. This study examined analgesic efficacy and side effects of epidurally administered clonidine in patients with severe, refractory RSD. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with severe chronic pain consistent with RSD were studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled design. Cervical or lumbar epidural catheters were inserted for patients with upper or lower extremity RSD, respectively, and patients received, in random order on three consecutive days, epidural injection of clonidine, 300 or 700 micrograms, or placebo. Pain (by visual analog score (VAS) and McGill Pain Questionnaire), sedation, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored at specified intervals for 6 h after injection. Patients who responded to clonidine, but not placebo, then entered a trial of open-label, continuous epidural infusion of clonidine (10-50 micrograms/h). RESULTS: Clonidine, but not placebo, caused pain relief, sedation, and decreased blood pressure and heart rate after bolus epidural injection. The smaller clonidine dose (300 micrograms), produced pain relief and decreases in blood pressure and heart rate similar to those of the 700 micrograms dose, but with less sedation. Epidural clonidine was infused for a mean of 43 days in 19 patients at a mean rate of 32 micrograms/h for sustained analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: Transdermal clonidine has been demonstrated to produce analgesia in the area surrounding its application site in patients with SMP. The current study indicates that extensive analgesia may be obtained by epidural administration. Sedation and hypotension may limit bolus epidural clonidine administration for RSD. The role for chronic epidural infusion of clonidine has not yet been established.","Adult, Analgesics/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Heart Rate/drug effects, Humans, Injections, Epidural, Pain/drug therapy, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy/*drug therapy",-1
8698994,Fever in neurologic diseases.,"Powers JH, Scheld WM",Infect Dis Clin North Am. 1996 Mar;10(1):45-66.,"In the sense that the brain houses the central mechanism for the regulation of body temperature, almost all illnesses that cause fever must interact with the central nervous system. There are far fewer diseases, however, in which the nervous system symptomatology is of prime diagnostic importance. A helpful way to view fever in association with neurologic disease is to roughly divide these disease entities into four broad categories: (1) neurologic impairment resulting from fever itself, (2) fever as the sole manifestation of a central nervous system infection, (3) systemic febrile disorders with central nervous system signs and symptoms, and (4) primary neurologic diseases, either central or peripheral in origin, with fever as a presenting sign. This article discusses the clinical presentation of disorders in each of these categories as an aid to the clinician in diagnosing and differentiating between these syndromes.","Brain Abscess/complications, Brain Diseases/*complications/etiology, Fever/complications/*etiology, Heat Stroke/complications, Humans, Malignant Hyperthermia/complications, Meningitis/complications, Sarcoidosis/complications, Sepsis/complications, Serum Sickness/complications",-1

Protein binding of BMS-204352 was determined in sera from several species, namely, rat, monkey, dog, and human. Data indicated that the compound was shown to be highly protein bound in serum from all species (ca. 99.6%). In order to test for the potential for drug-drug interactions and competitive displacement of BMS-204352 by diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, and warfarin, in vitro experiments were performed using spiked human serum and ex vivo human plasma samples. Protein binding was determined using equilibrium dialysis for 4 h at maximal therapeutic concentrations for each drug alone or in appropriate combination in spiked serum samples. Ex vivo samples from a clinical BMS-204352 study (0, 1, and 24 h) were dialyzed separately after addition of diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin. Drug content in biological matrices was measured for radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting. Results indicated that (1) addition of diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin did not alter the free fraction of BMS-204352; (2) BMS-204352 did not displace diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin from their protein binding sites, and (3) comparison of ex vivo plasma samples after BMS-204352 dosing indicated no impact of BMS-204352 and/or its metabolites on the free fraction of diazepam, phenytoin, propranolol, or warfarin. In conclusion, the potential for a drug-drug interaction due to alterations in protein binding with BMS-204352 is unlikely.","Animals, Blood Proteins/*metabolism, Dogs, Drug Interactions, Humans, Indoles/*blood/pharmacokinetics, Macaca fascicularis, Neuroprotective Agents/*blood/pharmacokinetics, Protein Binding, Rats",-1

METHODS: Data were collected on age, marital status, antispasticity medications, duration of injury, level and completeness of injury, stature, and weight. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated for all participants. A health questionnaire was used to collect data on snoring and respiratory history. Habitual snorers were defined as those who reported loud snoring more than 1 night per week. RESULTS: The mean age (+/- SD) was 51.2 +/- 14.8 years, and 84 of 197 (42.6%) were habitual snorers. The most obese research subjects, regardless of antispasticity medication use, were more likely to report snoring, but the risk of snoring was greatest among subjects who were obese and used antispasticity medication. Subjects who used antispasticity medication and had a BMI above the median (> or = 25.3 kg/m2) had a 7-fold risk of reporting snoring compared with subjects below the median who did not use antispasticity medication (P = .001). The greatest risk occurred in those who used diazepam alone or baclofen and diazepam together and had a BMI at or above the median. Subjects who used these medications and had a BMI below the median did not have a significantly increased risk. Neurological motor completeness, level of injury, age, and years since injury were not significant predictors of snoring. CONCLUSION: Because snoring is a marker for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the data suggest that in obese individuals with SCI, the use of antispasticity medications may be a risk factor for OSA.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Body Mass Index, Humans, Logistic Models, Middle Aged, Muscle Hypotonia/complications/physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects, Neuromuscular Agents/therapeutic use, Obesity/complications/physiopathology, Sleep Apnea Syndromes/*complications/*physiopathology, Snoring/*complications/*physiopathology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications/*physiopathology",-1

Testing a dose of 10 mg twice daily for 5 days (n = 17) was stopped early because of drowsiness around day 5, interfering with regular patient care. A dose of 10 mg twice daily for 3 days was well tolerated, despite reported drowsiness in 12 of 43 patients. First-dose application by rectiole was feasible in 97% of the 104 patients. No blood pressure drop or respiratory arrest or insufficiency were detected, whereas the 2-week case fatality rate was similar to that of controls matched for age, sex, and stroke severity. We conclude that testing the GABAergic activity during the acute phase of stroke by 10 mg diazepam twice daily for 3 days is well tolerated and practically feasible, and it does not subject patients to an increased risk of potential serious adverse effects.

It induces sedative/hypnotic effects in rodents at doses much lower than those for anticonvulsant and myorelaxant activities. Clinically, zolpidem is indicated for the short term treatment of insomnia. It has a short half-life (2.4h), with no active metabolite, and does not accumulate during repeated administration. The pharmacokinetic profile associated with the absence of active metabolites is consistent with the short duration of action and absence of residual effects that have been observed. Polysomnographic experience indicates that zolpidem induces a sleep pattern which is similar to that of physiological sleep, and which produces either no or only minimal effects on sleep architecture after abrupt discontinuation. Aspects of the general safety of zolpidem have been studied in data obtained from healthy volunteers and patients, both adult and elderly, during its clinical development and in post-marketing experience. Zolpidem appears to be well-tolerated in adults and in the elderly, when administered in accordance with prescribing instructions.

Three published studies have addressed the use of tiagabine for bipolar disorder (BPD); two described positive results and one negative results. We assessed the efficacy of add-on tiagabine in a larger sample of adult BPD outpatients. METHODS: Twenty-two adult outpatients with DSM-IV diagnosed BPD of some type who were considered unsatisfactory responders to standard medications for BPD were treated in an open fashion with adjunctive tiagabine in a low-dose range. After baseline demographic data and mood state at the time of entry were documented, each patient was monitored clinically for at least 6 months while the dose of tiagabine was adjusted according to the patient's clinical status. The subjects were rated using the clinical global impression-bipolar version scale (CGI-BP). RESULTS: After 6 months, eight (36%) of the patients were responders to tiagabine by CGI-BP rating. The dose range of tiagabine for responders was 1-8 mg per day. All 14 nonresponders had to discontinue tiagabine because of unacceptable but reversible side effects; one nonresponder experienced breakthrough absence seizures. LIMITATIONS: This study was performed in a nonrandom, open naturalistic clinical setting. The sample size was small. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose tiagabine appears to have mood-stabilizing and antimanic properties as an add-on medication for some adult outpatients who have BPD refractory to standard medications. Tiagabine appears to be safe for most adult BPD outpatients. The results of this preliminary open study await confirmation by double-blind controlled studies.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Resistance, Female, GABA Agonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nipecotic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

Our analysis of 24 clinical trials demonstrates the large diversity of outcome measures and measurement instruments that have been used to detect differences between treatment and placebo in the management of FMS. Whereas certain outcomes, such as self-reported pain and sleep quality, were frequently measured, other clinically important outcomes, such as functional and psychological status, were infrequently included in data collection.

12637113,"Gabapentin dosing for neuropathic pain: evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials.","Backonja M, Glanzman RL",Clin Ther. 2003 Jan;25(1):81-104.,"BACKGROUND: Pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, and neuropathic pain is among the most common types of pain. Despite its prevalence, neuropathic pain is often underrecognized and inadequately treated. Many cases are refractory to the medications traditionally used for pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered first-line agents for neuropathic pain, but their use is limited by unwanted side effects and a risk of cardiovascular mortality. OBJECTIVES: The goals of this article were to review data on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and to determine the optimal dosing schedule. METHODS: Randomized controlled studies of gabapentin for neuropathic pain were identified through a search of PubMed and MEDLINE from 1966 to the present using the search terms gabapentin, randomized, placebo, and pain. Abstracts of identified articles were screened for study size (>100 patients per treatment arm) and use of appropriate efficacy measures. A separate review based on information provided by the manufacturer of gabapentinaand clinical trial Web sites was conducted to ascertain whether there had been any other relevant industry- or government-sponsored trials. The manufacturer provided additional unpublshed study data. RESULTS: Data from 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included in the review, 1 of which has not yet been published. Gabapentin was effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and other neuropathic pain syndromes. It relieved symptoms of allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, and hyperesthesia. Adverse effects were typically mild to moderate and usually subsided within approximately 10 days from the initiation of treatment. Based on available data, it appears that treatment should be started at a dose of 900 mg/d (300 mg/d on day 1, 600 mg/d on day 2, and 900 mg/d on day 3). Additional titration to 1800 mg/d is recommended for greater efficacy. Doses up to 3600 mg/d may be needed in some patients. The effective dose should be individualized according to patient response and tolerability. CONCLUSION: At doses of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of adults with neuropathic pain.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Amines, Analgesics/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Diabetic Neuropathies/drug therapy, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Herpesviridae Infections/complications, Humans, Neuralgia/drug therapy/etiology, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*complications, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Syndrome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
12858070,Update on cluster headache.,"May A, Leone M",Curr Opin Neurol. 2003 Jun;16(3):333-40.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although cluster headache has traditionally been thought of as a vascular headache disorder, its periodicity suggests an involvement of central areas such as the hypothalamus. This review covers the past 3 years, which have seen remarkable progress in understanding the pathophysiology of circadian headache syndromes and have brought exciting news. RECENT FINDINGS: As more cluster headache patients are seen by headache specialists, new forms of this well-defined primary headache syndrome are being identified. In addition, we discuss recent findings with regard to abnormalities in the secretion of hormones, genetic influences, neuroimaging of cluster headache attacks, and the use of newer substances as preventive therapy in cluster headache. SUMMARY: We have entered a new diagnostic and therapeutic era in primary headache disorders. In recent reports, the use of deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus has enabled intractable chronic cluster headache patients to be successfully operated upon. Further research in this field is urgently needed and the recent possibility of combining deep brain stimulation with positron emission tomography will certainly help to unravel the brain circuitry implicated in stimulation-produced analgesia. The time has come to use the evidence for a disorder of circadian rhythm in cluster headache to further the development of chronobiotics in the treatment of this disorder.","*Cluster Headache/epidemiology/genetics/physiopathology/therapy, Electric Stimulation Therapy, Genotype, Humans, Hypothalamus/physiopathology, Phenotype",-1

Orally administered medications generally offer limited benefits. This study examines the value of intrathecally administered baclofen in the treatment of 19 children with severe spasticity of cerebral origin: eight of whom sustained brain injury associated with trauma, near drowning, or cardiac arrest; 10 with cerebral palsy (spastic quadriplegia); and one child with Leigh's disease. At the time of entry into the study, patients ranged from 4 to 19 years of age, and all were completely dependent on caretakers for activities of daily living. Children who responded positively to a trial dose of intrathecal baclofen underwent insertion of a drug delivery system for continuous infusion. This was followed by a double-blind trial of baclofen or placebo and follow-up review at 3 and 6 months, and yearly thereafter. Seven children did not undergo pump implantation because of excess sedation or poor response. The 12 remaining children have been followed for a period of 1 to 5 years. Favorable responses were present in all 12 children as determined by the Ashworth Scale, with the greatest benefit being reduction of lower limb tone. Except in the case of one child who had reduction in lower limb tone that resulted in difficulty with transfers, the caretakers all reported significant benefits from intrathecal baclofen, with improvement in muscle tone, behavior, sitting, and general ease of care being most commonly noted. Central side effects were seen in some children who received continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion and included hypotension (two patients), bradycardia (two), apnea or respiratory depression (two), and sedation (one). During a total of 568 months of pump operation there were 10 mechanical complications, including two related to pump or side port failure and eight related to catheter kinks, extrusions, or dislodgment. Pump pocket effusion occurred in five children and a cerebrospinal fluid fistula was seen in one child. Local infection occurred in three children and meningitis in two children. The results demonstrate the potential value of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for treatment of severe spasticity of cerebral origin. However, this treatment can result in significant complications and more experience is required before the long-term benefits can be determined.","Adolescent, Baclofen/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Brain Injuries/*complications, Cerebral Palsy/*complications, Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable/adverse effects, Infusions, Parenteral/methods, Injections, Spinal/methods, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic, use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology, Treatment Outcome",-1

The case-notes of 263 consecutive patients attending a tertiary referral centre in whom GBT had been added to concomitant anti-epileptic drugs were reviewed. There were 119 males (45%); the median age was 35 years (range 15-81 years) and the median duration of epilepsy was 20 years. The median dose of GBT administered was 1,600 mg (range 300-4,800 mg). Twenty-nine patients (11%) had a reduction in seizure frequency of greater than 50% and 7 (3%) achieved seizure freedom of 6 months' duration at least while taking GBT. Side-effects were reported by 169 patients (61%) and in 40 (15%) an increase in seizure frequency of 50% occurred, this being the commonest reason for GBT withdrawal.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The anti-inflammatory mechanism of corticosteroids is considered to be caused by the inhibition of phospholipase A2, which plays an important role in the pain mechanism of lumbar disc problems. Although some authors have demonstrated that the use of intramuscular bupivacaine during lumbar discectomy resulted in a marked reduction of postoperative back pain, others have reported that the key intervention was probably the administration of epidural corticosteroid. The coadministration of these two drugs in lumbar disc surgery for the relief of postoperative back pain has yet not been studied adequately. OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the combined use of perioperative corticosteroids and bupivacaine for the relief of postoperative pain after lumbar disc surgery. METHODS: Forty-four selected patients had acute-onset single-level unilateral herniated nucleus pulposus that were refractory to conservative management. All patients underwent lumbar disc surgery under standard general anesthesia. Before surgical incision, the skin and subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with 10 mL of 1% lidocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline to produce local vasoconstriction. During wound closure, 20 mL 0.9% saline in Group 1 (n = 22) and 20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine in Group 2 (n = 22) were injected into the paravertebral muscles and subcutaneus tissues. In addition, a piece of autologous fat taken from the wound was first soaked in 40 mg of methylprednisolone for 10 minutes, then placed over the exposed nerve root, and the remaining steroid was flushed into the wound in Group 2. The wound was closed after drug administration in both groups. In the postoperative period, all patients received 100 mg of meperidine intramuscularly when needed and were allowed to receive a second dose at least 4 hours later than the first dose for postoperative analgesia. Postoperative back pain intensity, heart rate, and mean arterial pressure were assessed 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the conclusion of surgery. RESULTS: Visual analog scale pain scores for the postoperative recordings were lower in Group 2 than in Group 1, but these findings were not statistically significant. Patients in Group 1 received 77.3 +/- 48.8 mg meperidine, and those in Group 2 received 31.8 +/- 45.5 mg meperidine, for pain medication in the first 12 hours (P < 0.05). Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were not significantly different between the two groups in all recording periods. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the perioperative use of bupivacaine and corticosteroids during lumbar discectomy maintains effective postoperative analgesia and decreases opioid usage without complications.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones/*administration & dosage, Adult, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anesthetics, Local/administration & dosage, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Bupivacaine/*administration & dosage, Diskectomy/adverse effects/*methods, Drug Administration Routes, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Heart Rate/drug effects, Humans, Intervertebral Disc Displacement/diagnosis/*surgery, Low Back Pain/etiology/prevention & control, Lumbosacral Region, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Meperidine/therapeutic use, Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage, Pain Measurement, Pain, Postoperative/etiology/prevention & control, *Perioperative Care, Tomography, X-Ray Computed, Treatment Outcome",-1
7656504,Clinical pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole.,"Landes BD, Petite JP, Flouvat B",Clin Pharmacokinet. 1995 Jun;28(6):458-70.,"Lansoprazole, a benzimidazole derivative with antisecretory and antiulcer activities, inhibits the acid pump activity at the final stage of the enzyme process and therefore reduces the acid secretion of parietal cells. Lansoprazole is converted to active metabolites in the acid environment of these cells. It is rapidly absorbed from a gastric acid-resistant formulation and is approximately 97% bound in human plasma. Single dose pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole appear to be linear over the range from 15 to 60mg. Food and time of dose influence absorption after single doses, but do not modify the antisecretory effect of multiple doses. Lansoprazole is extensively metabolised following oral administration into sulphone and 5-hydroxylated metabolites by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C18. Two other metabolites have been identified in plasma: sulphide and hydroxylated sulphone. Mean plasma elimination half-life (t1/2) is between 1.3 and 2.1 hours in healthy volunteers. 15 to 23% of the total dose is found in urine as free and conjugated hydroxylated metabolites, while unchanged lansoprazole is not detected. The pharmacokinetic profile of the drug is not modified by multiple administration. In healthy elderly volunteers, area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and t1/2 are significantly greater after single administration occurs to the same extent as in young volunteers. Renal failure has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole, but severe hepatic failure causes a significant decrease in clearance and an increase in the AUC and t1/2 of lansoprazole. This is accompanied by modifications in the AUC of metabolites, but severe hepatic failure has minimal effect on accumulation of the drug after multiple administration. The pharmacokinetics of lansoprazole in patients with acid-related disorders do not differ from those in healthy volunteers. Studies of interactions of lansoprazole with warfarin, prednisone, theophylline, phenazone (antipyrine), diazepam, phenytoin and oral contraceptives suggest minimal risk of any clinically significant interaction.","2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles, Aging/metabolism, Anti-Ulcer Agents/*pharmacokinetics, Drug Interactions, Gastrointestinal Diseases/metabolism, Humans, Lansoprazole, Liver Failure/metabolism, Omeprazole/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, Renal Insufficiency/metabolism",-1

Treatment using chemotherapy or other treatment of the primary tumor to various immunologically directed therapies has been attempted but outcomes have been poor. We discuss a patient with ovarian carcinoma and PCD seen in our institution who showed a marked beneficial response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and methylprednisolone. A Medline search from 1966-2002 produced fifteen cases of PCD confirmed by antibody testing that were treated with IVIG, either alone, or with a combination of other therapies. The clinical characteristics and treatment responses of these patients are analyzed in this review. Most patients that were treated with IVIG and had what was defined as a good response were treated within one month of symptoms. Patients treated between one month and three months often had stable disease and patients treated after three months of symptoms usually had a poor outcome. Early treatment with sufficiently high doses of IVIG seems to provide a better chance of treatment success. The additional benefit of early high dose intravenous methylprednisolone is unclear. Due to the devastating nature of the disease, a trial of IVIG and steroids is warranted as early as possible in a dose of 2g/kg to any patient with a clinical picture of PCD and positive antibodies.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use, Autoantigens/*immunology, DNA-Binding Proteins/*immunology, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*therapeutic use, Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology, *Nerve Tissue Proteins, Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology, Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration/*drug therapy/immunology",-1

Few randomized controlled trials of medications for pain in persons with SCI have been conducted. This study was designed to determine whether amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is efficacious in relieving chronic pain and improving pain-related physical and psychosocial dysfunction in persons with SCI. Eighty-four participants with SCI and chronic pain were randomized to a 6-week trial of amitriptyline or an active placebo, benztropine mesylate. All pre- and post-treatment assessments were conducted by evaluators blind to the allocation. Regression analyses were conducted to examine whether there was a medication group effect on the primary (average pain intensity) and secondary outcome measures. No significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers.

Amitriptyline recently was shown to antagonize N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and in this study, the authors sought to determine the effect of amitriptyline alone and with the opioid alfentanil on hyperalgesia and allodynia produced by intradermal injection of capsaicin. METHODS: Forty-six healthy volunteers in the general clinical research center received repeated intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg) alone or before and after systemic injection of 4 mg midazolam, 25 mg amitriptyline, alfentanil by computer-controlled infusion, or amitriptyline plus alfentanil. Acute pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were determined at specified intervals. Blood was obtained for alfentanil and amitriptyline assay. RESULTS: Capsaicin injection produced acute pain followed by hyperalgesia and allodynia. Alfentanil reduced these pain responses in a plasma-concentration-dependent manner, and reduction in hyperalgesia and allodynia correlated with reduction in acute pain. Amitriptyline alone had no effect and did not potentiate alfentanil. Alfentanil produced concentration-dependent nausea, an effect diminished by amitriptyline. DISCUSSION: These data correspond with previous studies in volunteers demonstrating reduction in hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal injection of capsaicin by systemically administered opioids, and they suggest that this reduction may be secondary to reduced nociceptive input by acute analgesia. These data do not support the use of acute systemic administration of amitriptyline for acute pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, although the roles of chronic treatment and spinal administration are being investigated.","Adult, Alfentanil/blood/*pharmacology, Amitriptyline/blood/*pharmacology, Analgesics, Opioid/blood/*pharmacology, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/blood/*pharmacology, Capsaicin, Drug Interactions, Female, Humans, Hyperalgesia/chemically induced/*drug therapy, Injections, Intradermal, Male, Pain/chemically induced/*drug therapy, Reproducibility of Results",-1

It is widely used, and administered in various ways for the control of acute and chronic pain states. There are, however, certain types of pain and certain clinical conditions in which morphine cannot be used due to the risk of possible complications. These are usually pain states associated with intracranial hypertension, the presence of serious respiratory problems, the onset of major opioid tolerance, persistent vomiting, and so on. The search for ""alternative analgesics"" has been in progress for a decade, alternatives that could be used alone or in combination for spinal administration in the treatment of complex chronic pain states and with a low incidence of secondary effects. Today, research is carefully assessing the clinical effectiveness and the side effects of a series of drugs for spinal administration, that is, epidural or intrathecal, such as the new narcotics, alpha-2 agonists, central muscle relaxants, calcitonin, and local anesthetics. In this alternative analgesic category we have to mention the somatotrophin-release inhibiting factor (SRIF), which is an ubiquitous native hormone with widespread, predominantly inhibitory actions, and octreotide, its synthetic analogue. In this article we review the literature on the natural drug and its synthetic analogue, paying particular attention to the problems connected with intraspinal administration and analgesic properties.","Chronic Disease, Humans, Injections, Epidural, Neoplasms/complications, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Somatostatin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use",-1

12582452,Newer GABAergic agents for pharmacotherapy of infantile spasms.,Reddy DS,Drugs Today (Barc). 2002 Oct;38(10):657-75.,"Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic syndrome in infants and young children. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) has been the mainstay for the therapeutic management of infantile spasms and other developmental epilepsies. Clinical benefits of ACTH in infantile spasms could partially relate to its stimulatory effects on the release of adrenocorticosteroids and neurosteroids. Glucocorticoids, pyridoxine and ketogenic diet therapy have all been used for the treatment of refractory infantile spasms. Recent studies indicate that several newer anticonvulsant agents, which are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors, are as effective as ACTH in acutely controlling infantile spasms. The efficacy of agents that enhance GABA-mediated inhibition (such as vigabatrin and benzodiazepines) for rapid and complete abolition of infantile spasms has been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Ganaxolone, a novel neuroactive steroid has, however, demonstrated outstanding efficacy and better tolerability in children with intractable infantile spasms. Zonisamide, topiramate, deoxycorticosterone and neurosteroids are emerging as effective treatment approaches. These new antiepileptic drugs represent a potential nonhormonal approach for infantile spasms, but additional studies are needed to verify their efficacy and tolerability. Future studies will hopefully identify rational antiseizure drugs that not only control infantile spasms but also abrogate its risk on the development of the brain.","Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/genetics/therapeutic use, Amino Acid Sequence, GABA Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use, Humans, Infant, Molecular Sequence Data, Spasms, Infantile/*drug therapy/metabolism",-1

Underlying etiologies as well as diagnostic and treatment issues vary from that of younger adults and deserve special consideration. REVIEW SUMMARY: The substantially increased risk of seizures and epilepsy in the elderly is associated with medical conditions that affect this group such as stroke, dementia, and metabolic disturbances. In addition, there is an increased incidence and associated mortality of status epilepticus among seniors. Distinguishing epilepsy from paroxysmal nonepileptic events can be a particular challenge. As in the general adult population, EEG and MRI are the cornerstones of diagnostic assessment; however, the clinician must be aware of nonspecific changes associated with aging that do not necessarily indicate an underlying predisposition for epilepsy. Finally, there are unique challenges to the treatment of epilepsy in this population, but fortunately there are multiple treatment options available, including nonpharmacological therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the unique challenges in identifying and treating the elderly patient with epilepsy is important for effective management as well as maximizing quality of life. However, further studies in this area are still needed to establish optimal treatment strategies.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, *Epilepsy/diagnosis/etiology/therapy, Humans",-1

Major determinants of fatal outcomes were: increasing age, longer duration of status epilepticus before initiation of therapy and central nervous system infection as a causal factor.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Child, Demography, Diazepam/therapeutic use, Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic/*complications, Female, Humans, Intensive Care Units, Male, Middle Aged, Phenytoin/therapeutic use, Prognosis, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Status Epilepticus/*etiology/mortality/therapy, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome, Treatment Outcome",-1

However, among the many people with epilepsy, few incorporate exercise into their daily routine. Whether it is because of parental or physician restriction, the fact remains that people with epilepsy are less fit and are not getting the exercise they need. For many years, patients with seizure disorders have been discouraged from participating in physical fitness and team sports due to the fear that it will exacerbate their seizure disorder. However, this overprotective attitude has been slowly changing in light of more recent data on this subject. The evidence shows that patients with good seizure control can participate in both contact and non-contact sports without adversely affecting seizure frequency. This article reviews the effects of exercise on seizure control among patients with epilepsy. It examines the morbidity and mortality associated with exercise, as well as its psychological and physiological effects. Various topics concerning antiepileptic drugs and exercise are also discussed.","Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Attitude to Health, Decision Making, Epilepsy/classification/*physiopathology/prevention & control, Humans, Incidence, Motor Activity/physiology, Physical Education and Training, Physical Fitness/physiology, Sports/*physiology, United States/epidemiology",-1
12925932,A case of unilateral neglect in Huntington's disease.,"Ho AK, Manly T, Nestor PJ, Sahakian BJ, Bak TH, Robbins TW, Rosser AE, Barker RA",Neurocase. 2003 Jun;9(3):261-73.,"Unilateral neglect, an attentional deficit in detecting and acting on information coming from one side of space, is a relatively common consequence of right hemisphere stroke. Although neglect has been observed following damage to a variety of brain structures, to date no reports exist of neglect phenomena arising from Huntington's Disease (HD). However, reports in the animal and human literature suggest that neglect is possible following damage to a primary site for Huntington's pathology, the basal ganglia. Here we present a patient (BG) with genetically proven HD who, in the context of the mild intellectual, executive and attentional impairments associated with the disorder, showed a remarkably severe and stable neglect for left space. MRI and electrophysiological results make it unlikely that the spatial bias could be accounted for by basic sensory loss. In addition, behavioural investigation indicated that, although BG's neglect operated in a very striking manner along body-centred co-ordinates (missing almost all information presented to her left), more general limitations in visual attention were apparent to the left-side of information presented entirely to the right of the body midline. Further evidence is presented showing that the neglect was manifest on tactile and auditory tasks as well as those presented in the visual domain. The presence of neglect in HD in this case is novel and somewhat puzzling, particularly as flourodeoyglucose positron emission tomography revealed bilateral caudate hypoperfusion. Reducing the statistical threshold on this analysis revealed a potential frontal hypometabolism that was more marked in the right than left hemisphere. However, as this was only apparent at a threshold below that normally considered acceptable (due to the resulting number of false positives), this possible account of the neglect must be viewed very cautiously.","Attention, Auditory Perception, Brain/*pathology, Caudate Nucleus/pathology, Cognition Disorders/*etiology, Electroencephalography, Female, Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/diagnostic use, Functional Laterality, Humans, Huntington Disease/*complications, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Middle Aged, Perceptual Disorders/*etiology/pathology, Radiopharmaceuticals/diagnostic use, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Touch, Visual Perception",-1

Rarely it may be caused by a cortical lesion. The precipitating factor in 70% of all cases is an infarct. We describe an unusual case of a patient with palatal myoclonus who had an old ipsilateral cerebellar infarct and a new contralateral subcortical (corona radiata) infarct. We postulate that the new infarct caused disinhibition of the old cerebellar infarct, resulting in palatal myoclonus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain did not show any hypertrophy of the inferior olivary nucleus.

Often the relative contributions of family and personal relationships, finances, work, past pain experiences and personality outweigh those of the nociceptive or neuropathic processes from which most pain originates. Recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of pain may lead to improved drug treatments; however, non-drug treatments--education, lifestyle modification, exercise and reassurance--should be used routinely to improve patients' quality of life. Patients with persistent pain that is difficult to control or has complex psychosocial influences, or who have a history of medication misuse, should be referred to a multidisciplinary pain centre. Selected patients may be offered invasive options such as nerve blocks or spinal-cord stimulation. The best outcomes are achieved in patients treated in group-based pain-management programs using cognitive-behavioural therapy to improve physical function, change unhelpful thinking and improve patients' understanding of their situation.","Analgesics/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Family Practice, Health Behavior, Humans, Pain/classification/drug therapy, Pain Clinics, *Pain Management, Patient Education as Topic, Psychological Techniques, Treatment Outcome",-1

DATA SOURCES: Case report information was obtained from the medical record, the patient, and the physicians involved in this patient's case. MEDLINE and Index Medicus were searched to obtain relevant published literature from January 1942 to May 1997 using the terms quinine, muscle cramps, liver disease, and hepatotoxicity. CASE SUMMARY: A 57-year-old Native American woman presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, generalized myalgia, headache, fever, chills, and rigor. The alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase concentrations were dramatically elevated. Quinine was suspected as the cause after several days of hospitalization and continued therapy. With discontinuation of the quinine, the patient's symptoms resolved within 48 hours and the liver enzyme concentrations declined within 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Documented hepatotoxicity has occurred with quinidine, the optical isomer of quinine.

The first purpose of this paper is to address whether the ""new"" AEDs have advantages over the ""old"" drugs. The second purpose is to teach those interested in clinical pharmacology about the use of Web-based information access to answer a neurology/clinical pharmacology problem: to compare the efficacy and side effects of topiramate versus lamotrigine versus phenobarbital using odds ratios. Cost of all three AEDs was also compared. A number of new AEDs, including topiramate and lamotrigine, have been developed for chronic focal and secondarily generalized epileptic seizures. Efficacy of these drugs as anticonvulsants does not seem to be superior to that of traditional anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital. However, the advantage of the new drugs is a different spectrum of possible adverse events. Newer AEDs may or may not induce sedation and may minimize noncompliance by reducing side effects of lethargy and cognitive impairment. The difficulty in achieving therapeutic dosage because of side effects makes one consider whether these agents are ""better"" than the oldest and most side effect-prone AED, phenobarbital. The new AEDs have less frequent interactions, leading to improved tolerability with comedication. This exercise compares two ""new"" AEDs, topiramate and lamotrigine, with phenobarbital by evaluating efficacies and side effects using relative odds ratios, a method commonly used in drug development research. Development of new algorithms and/or new knowledge will bring beneficial tools to all clinical pharmacologists.","Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use, Costs and Cost Analysis, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Fructose/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/economics/*therapeutic use, Humans, Odds Ratio, Phenobarbital/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use, Triazines/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use",-1

Twenty-four patients were evaluated urodynamically before and after placement of the intraurethral stent prosthesis. All the patients had been chronically managed with an indwelling urinary catheter, intermittent catheterization or condom catheters. Sixty-six per cent had history of recurrent urinary tract infection, 37% had symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. Nine patients had previous external sphincterotomy. Follow-up ranged from 3 39 months (mean 15.4 months). After stent insertion all patients were able to achieve spontaneous reflex voiding with the use of condom catheter. Postoperative urodynamics parameters bladder leak point pressure and residual urine volume decreased significantly after stent insertion. Stent insertion was accomplished without any operative complications. In four patients stent migration (16%) required telescoping a new system over the migrated stent. In two patients the stent was removed because of problems of infection and calculus formation. In conclusion, this system (Memotherm) is an attractive, and potentially reversible treatment for DESD in SCI patients.","Electromyography, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Postoperative Complications, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications/physiopathology, *Stents, Urethra/physiopathology/*surgery, Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic/etiology/physiopathology/*surgery, Urinary Catheterization, Urodynamics",-1

There were 2016 patients with partial seizures requiring adjunctive therapy who received gabapentin at doses up to 3600 mg/day in this open-label, multicenter, 16-week study. Of the 1055 patients evaluable for efficacy, 573 received gabapentin < or =1800 mg/day and 482 received > 1800 mg/day as the highest dose received. For the overall efficacy evaluable population, the percentage of patients achieving at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency was 76.0%; 46.4% of the patients were seizure free. Patients whose highest gabapentin dose did not require > 1800 mg/day had, at baseline, fewer seizures and were receiving fewer concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) at baseline than those patients requiring > 1800 mg/day. This suggests that patients requiring higher doses of gabapentin were more refractory to drug treatment at the start of the study. Gabapentin was well tolerated at all doses in this study. The results of the study demonstrate that gabapentin is effective as adjunctive therapy in patients with partial seizures whose seizures are inadequately controlled by traditional AEDs.","Acetates/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsies, Partial/*drug therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

BACKGROUND: During status epilepticus, neuroimaging may be used to exclude other neurologic conditions. Therefore, it is important to identify the neuroimaging features that are associated with status epilepticus. In addition, MRI characteristics may provide insight into the pathophysiologic changes during status epilepticus. METHODS: The history and neuroimaging examination results of three patients with complex partial status epilepticus were reviewed. Studies obtained during status epilepticus included diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), MR angiography (MRA), postcontrast T1-weighted MRI, T2-weighted MRI, and CT. Follow-up MRI was obtained in two patients, and autopsy results were available for the third. RESULTS: Some of the MRI and CT findings during partial status epilepticus mimicked those of acute ischemic stroke: DWI and T2-weighted MRI showed cortical hyperintensity with a corresponding low apparent diffusion coefficient, and CT showed an area of decreased attenuation with effacement of sulci and loss of gray-white differentiation. However, the lesions did not respect vascular territories, there was increased signal of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery on MRA, and leptomeningeal enhancement appeared on postcontrast MRI. On follow-up imaging, the abnormalities had resolved, but some cerebral atrophy was present. CONCLUSIONS: The radiologic characteristics of status epilepticus resemble those of ischemic stroke but can be differentiated based on lesion location and findings on MRA and postcontrast MRI. The MRI abnormalities indicated the presence of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema, hyperperfusion of the epileptic region, and alteration of the leptomeningeal blood-brain barrier. These changes reversed, but they resulted in some regional brain atrophy.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Brain/pathology, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Status Epilepticus/*pathology",-1

METHODS: Intrathecal baclofen (IB) therapy delivered by means of implanted infusion pumps was used for nine patients with severe spasticity. Six patients had multiple sclerosis, two cervical spinal cord injury, and one head injury. All were non-ambulatory. RESULTS: Patients showed improvement in many areas, including ability to transfer, seating, pain control, personal care, and liability to skin breakdown. Before IB therapy, only three of the nine patients were able to live at home in the community and six were institutionalized. At the end of our follow-up period, only one patient remained institutionalized, three lived in group homes and five lived at home in the community. In the year preceding pump implantation, the nine patients spent a total of 755 days in acute care hospitals. In the year following onset of IB therapy, they spent only 259 days in hospital. CONCLUSIONS: IB therapy can improve patient quality of life and can be cost-effective in carefully selected patients with severe spasticity and disability. The drug delivery catheter is that part of the therapeutic system most vulnerable to failure. Because of the varied expertise required to manage these patients effectively, and the potential for a variety of complications, it is essential that an IB program is supported by a well-organized multi-disciplinary medical team.","Adult, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, *Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1

11075846,Amitriptyline reduces myofascial tenderness in patients with chronic tension-type headache.,"Bendtsen L, Jensen R",Cephalalgia. 2000 Jul;20(6):603-10.,"The tricyclic anti-depressant amitriptyline is widely used in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the analgesic effect is caused by a reduction of muscle pain or by a general reduction of pain sensitivity. Thirty-three non-depressed patients with chronic tension-type headache were treated with amitriptyline 75 mg/day and with the highly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram 20 mg/day in a 32-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover study. At the end of each treatment period, actual headache intensity and pericranial myofascial tenderness were recorded, pressure pain detection and tolerance thresholds were measured in the finger and in the temporal region and the electrical pain threshold was measured at the labial commissure. Amitriptyline reduced tenderness and headache intensity significantly more than placebo (P=0.01 and P=0.04, respectively). The reduction in tenderness could be ascribed solely to the group of patients who responded to amitriptyline treatment by at least 30% reduction in headache while tenderness was unchanged in non-responders. Amitriptyline did not affect pressure or electrical pain thresholds at any of the examined locations. Citalopram had no significant effect on any of the examined parameters. These findings indicate that amitriptyline elicits its analgesic effect in chronic myofascial pain by reducing the transmission of painful stimuli from myofascial tissues rather than by reducing overall pain sensitivity. We suggest that this effect is caused by a segmental reduction of central sensitization in combination with a peripheral anti-nociceptive action.","Adult, Amitriptyline/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Analgesics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Citalopram/therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Electric Stimulation/adverse effects, Female, Headache Disorders/complications/*drug therapy, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Myofascial Pain Syndromes/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control, Pain Measurement, Pressure/adverse effects, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Tension-Type Headache/complications/*drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHODS: Chronic tension headache sufferers received structured massage therapy treatment directed toward neck and shoulder muscles. Headache frequency, duration, and intensity were recorded and compared with baseline measures. RESULTS: Compared with baseline values, headache frequency was significantly reduced within the first week of the massage protocol. The reduction of headache frequency continued for the remainder of the study (P =.009). The duration of headaches tended to decrease during the massage treatment period (P =.058). Headache intensity was unaffected by massage (P =.19). CONCLUSIONS: The muscle-specific massage therapy technique used in this study has the potential to be a functional, nonpharmacological intervention for reducing the incidence of chronic tension headache.","Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Incidence, *Massage, Pain Measurement, Relaxation Therapy, Research Design, Tension-Type Headache/epidemiology/physiopathology/*therapy, Time Factors, *Treatment Outcome",-1

This agent is approved for the short-term treatment of erosive reflux oesophagitis, active gastric ulcer, active duodenal ulcer and the treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric and duodenal ulcers. It is also approved for the long-term treatment of healed reflux oesophagitis, healed duodenal ulcer, the treatment of hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the eradication of Helicobacter pylori as a component of triple therapy with lansoprazole, clarithromycin and amoxicillin, or dual therapy with lansoprazole and amoxicillin. Its mechanism of action is to selectively inhibit the membrane enzyme H+/K+ ATPase in gastric parietal cells. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is more effective than placebo or histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists in the treatment of reflux oesophagitis. Lansoprazole administered at a dose of 30 mg daily produced faster relief of symptoms and superior healing rates in patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers or reflux oesophagitis than H2-receptor antagonists. A daily dose of 30 mg lansoprazole reduced epigastric pain faster than omeprazole 20 mg daily in patients with peptic ulcer disease but healing rates at 4 and 8 weeks were similar with both agents at these dosages. Lansoprazole was more effective than H2-receptor antagonists in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and produced similar treatment outcome to omeprazole. Lansoprazole in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin produced similar rates of eradication of H. pylori. In clinical trials, lansoprazole is well-tolerated and has a low frequency of side effects similar to that of H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole.","2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles, Animals, Anti-Ulcer Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology, Esophagitis, Peptic/drug therapy, Helicobacter Infections/drug therapy, Helicobacter pylori, Humans, Lansoprazole, Omeprazole/adverse effects/*analogs &, derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Peptic Ulcer/drug therapy, Proton Pump Inhibitors",-1

A total of 59 patients were evaluated during 4 wk of treatment and received 20 mg fluoxetine, 25 mg amitriptyline, or placebo daily. Pain intensity, pain relief, vital variables, and global evaluation were used to assess efficacy. To evaluate safety variables, the incidence of side effects was noted. Both amitriptyline and fluoxetine significantly reduced pain intensity compared with placebo. Similarly, pain relief was greater with both amitriptyline and fluoxetine than with placebo. At the end of the fourth week, fluoxetine was superior in efficacy to amitriptyline. The incidence of adverse effects was significantly greater with amitriptyline; dryness of the mouth was the most predominant side effect.

Eleven patients with spasticity of different etiology and one patient with idiopathic dystonia were studied. Six patients participated in a double-blind trial. Kinematic/dynamic and electromyographic (EMG) patterns were recorded during attempts at single-joint elbow or ankle voluntary movements and isometric contractions. Reflex responses were also recorded. Baclofen suppressed spastic signs in 10 patients: it eliminated clonus and decreased the co-contraction of antagonist and distant muscle groups. Baclofen could induce weakness, particularly in patients with cerebral palsy (CP). Patients with hemi-syndromes did not notice any effects of baclofen in their 'unaffected' limbs. Intrathecal baclofen could improve voluntary movements in some patients with spasticity resulting in better walking and usage of arms.

Children and young adults with severe spasticity and dystonia of cerebral origin are difficult to treat in spite of optimal systemic antispasmotic therapy with baclofen, tizanidine, dantrolene and/or diazepam. Intrathecal baclofen has therefore been applied in a group of young patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children and young adults from East Denmark with spasticity and 12 with dystonia aged 3-18 years (median 10.9 years) were tested, operated and treated with continuous intrathecal baclofen for a period of 2-64 months (median 22.2 months). Registration of efficacy, fillings, adjustments of baclofen and other therapies were performed in an out patient setting since 1995. RESULTS: Spasticity in lower extremities was reduced from Ashworth score 3.5-4.5 (median 4.2) to Ashworth score 2.5-4.0 (median 2.9; p < 0.001) during infusion with baclofen 5-33 micrograms/kg/24 hours (median 19 micrograms/kg/24 hours). The infusion catheter tip was placed at levels Th1-Th12 (median Th7.5). Peroral baclofen was reduced from an average of 5.0 to 0.44 mg/kg/24 hours, tizanidine from 0.4 to 0.1 mg/kg/24 hours, and dantrolene from 4.0 to 0.4 mg/kg/24 hours. After initial adjustments successively increased dosages of average 0.46 microgram/kg/month were needed to maintain the same level of efficacy. In questionnaires parents or guardians rated less spasticity in lower extremities in 15 out of 19 patients, and less pain in 13 out of 19 patients. CONCLUSION: Continuous intrathecal baclofen was effective in treating severe spasticity and dystonia of cerebral origin with major effect on muscles of the lower extremities, pelvis, and back and in particular opisthotonus was relieved. Efficacy on upper extremities was far less pronounced.","Adolescent, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Child, Child, Preschool, Dystonia/*drug therapy, GABA Agonists/*administration & dosage, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Injections, Spinal/instrumentation, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Quadriplegia/*drug therapy",-1

In order to provide satisfactory pain relief and prevent the possible sequelae of untreated pain, physicians must possess both knowledge and expertise in the use of opioid and nonopioid analgesics. Opioid analgesics have been underused in the management of pain. Opioids have a higher analgesic potency and wider range of indications than any of the other currently available medications for pain control. The second class of drugs, the nonopioid analgesics and adjuvants, has recently expanded to include new and potentially beneficial medications. This article furthers the understanding on how to use analgesics for a prompt, safe, and effective pharmacologic treatment of acute and chronic pain.","Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Pain/*drug therapy/physiopathology",-1

DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records. SETTING: An adult trauma/surgical ICU in an urban Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight mechanically ventilated adult trauma/ surgical ICU patients requiring >7 days of ICU care. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Daily doses of all opioid, sedative, hypnotic, and major tranquilizer drugs administered to each patient were measured, as was duration of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of the administration of analgesic, sedative, and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) for each patient. All opioids and benzodiazepines were converted to their respective fentanyl and lorazepam equivalent units based on potency and bioavailability. Calculation of the weaning rate for each patient during tapering from opioid and benzodiazepine medications was performed. The presence or absence of acute withdrawal syndrome was identified for each patient. Nine (32.1%) patients developed acute withdrawal syndrome potentially related to the administration of analgesic or sedative medications. Patients in the withdrawal group received significantly higher mean daily (p = .049) and peak (p = .032) doses of fentanyl equivalents, as well as higher mean daily lorazepam equivalents (p = .049) compared with patients not experiencing withdrawal. Patients in the withdrawal group were also significantly more likely to have received neuromuscular blocking agents (p = .004) or propofol (p =.026) for >1 day during ICU admission compared with patients not experiencing withdrawal. Duration of mechanical ventilation (p = .049), benzodiazepine therapy (p = .048), and propofol therapy (p = .049) was also significantly longer in the group experiencing withdrawal. Withdrawal patients received a significantly lower mean daily dose of haloperidol (p = .026). There was a significant association between the development of withdrawal syndrome and the presence of ARDS (p = .017). Finally, the slopes of the lines representing opioid and benzodiazepine drug weaning were more steep for the withdrawal group, although these results did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mechanically ventilated adult patients with extended ICU care (> or =7 days) who receive large doses of analgesic and sedative medications are at risk for acute withdrawal syndromes during drug weaning. The association between ARDS and withdrawal syndrome, combined with the observation that withdrawal syndromes were also associated with the use of neuromuscular blocking agents and prolonged mechanical ventilation, suggests that patients with ARDS may be more likely to receive high doses of analgesic and sedative medications, and are therefore at increased risk for withdrawal syndrome.","Acute Disease, Adult, Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Anti-Anxiety Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Benzodiazepines, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Haloperidol/therapeutic use, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/therapeutic use, Intensive Care Units, Length of Stay, Male, Middle Aged, Propofol/therapeutic use, *Respiration, Artificial, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult/therapy, Retrospective Studies, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology, Time Factors",-1

METHODS: The literature regarding clinical experience with spinal mu opioid agonists for chronic and cancer pain was reviewed. Experimental use of intrathecal non-mu opioid agonists and non-opioid agonists and antagonists was also reviewed. RESULTS: Intrathecal mu agonists, particularly morphine, are effective for most patients with cancer pain, though in some patients rapid tolerance or marked resistance develop. Varied results are seen among chronic pain patients. Delta opioid agonists and a variety of non-opioid agonist analgesics are effective in standard analgesic testing paradigms, and some agents are effective in clinical trials. NMDA and NK-1 receptor antagonists are effective in models that produce sensitization of spinal dorsal horn neurons. CONCLUSIONS: A number of new agents appear to have promise as intrathecal drugs for patients with intractable chronic and cancer pain.","Anesthesia, Spinal/instrumentation/*methods, Catheters, Indwelling, Chronic Disease, Humans, Neoplasms/*physiopathology, Pain/etiology/*prevention & control",-1

Another HIV protease inhibitor: no proven advance.,MISSING,Prescrire Int. 2001 Jun;10(53):70-2.,"(1) The reference antiretroviral treatment for HIV-infected patients is a three-drug regimen combining drugs from different families, namely two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors + a protease inhibitor or a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor. In our opinion, indinavir is the first-choice protease inhibitor. (2) The clinical file on amprenavir is limited. In particular, it is not known whether the recommended dose regimen (1 200 mg twice a day) is the best one. A 48-week trial involving 232 patients previously untreated with antiretrovirals showed that the combination of amprenavir (1 200 mg) + lamivudine (150 mg) + zidovudine (300 mg), administered twice a day, was more effective than lamivudine + zidovudine on viral load. (3) An unblinded trial involving 504 patients, who had already received a reverse transcriptase inhibitor but no protease inhibitor, compared three-drug regimens consisting of amprenavir (1 200 mg twice a day) and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or indinavir (800 mg three times a day) and two reverse transcriptase inhibitors, for 48 weeks. Changes in viral load and the CD4+ lymphocyte count did not favour the amprenavir-containing regimen. (4) Laboratory studies suggest that the risk of cross-resistance between amprenavir and other HIV protease inhibitors is lower than with other compounds of this class. However, it is unclear whether this means that amprenavir would be clinically effective after failure of one or several other protease inhibitors. (5) The main adverse effects of amprenavir are gastrointestinal disorders and paraesthesias. Overall, the safety profile resembles that of the other protease inhibitors. (6) Like other protease inhibitors, amprenavir can potentially interact with many other drugs, owing to its hepatic metabolism. (7) Amprenavir is taken in two daily doses irrespective of meal times, but this advantage over other protease inhibitors is cancelled out by the fact that patients have to swallow 8 large soft capsules at each intake. (8) In our opinion, pending further data, amprenavir should be used only in well-conducted clinical trials.","Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active, Clinical Trials as Topic, HIV Protease Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Humans, Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHODS: Ninety-six adults 18 years or older with acute repetitive seizures, 70 of whom received treatment, were randomized into the 2 studies. Active and placebo medications were supplied in prefilled, identical-appearing delivery systems. In study 001, patients received a second dose 4 hours after the initial treatment. Patients in study 003 received only 1 treatment. Patients were observed for 12 hours after the first dose. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in seizure frequency in patients who received DZP compared with the placebo group. The median number of seizures per hour in the group treated with DZP rectal gel was 0.00, vs 0.13 in the placebo group (P =.002). In addition, significantly more DZP rectal gel-treated patients remained seizure-free during the 12-hour observation period (71% [22/31] vs 28% [11/39]). Using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, time to the next seizure was found to be significantly longer in DZP rectal gel-treated than placebo-treated patients (P<.001). Global assessment as provided by the caregivers was in favor of DZP rectal gel for both study 001 (P =.17) and study 003 (P =.02).

10582773,Epidemiology and drug treatment of epilepsy in elderly people.,Faught E,Drugs Aging. 1999 Oct;15(4):255-69.,"Seizures are extremely common in the elderly, with an annual incidence reaching 100 per 100000 people aged over 60 years. Most are precipitated by acute symptomatic illnesses such as stroke or systemic disease. Chronic neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease may also cause seizures. The aetiology of seizures in many patients is unknown. Seizures may be situational and subside quickly, but the prevalence of chronic seizures--epilepsy--is as high as 1% in the elderly. The majority of seizures are of partial onset, especially complex partial. Complex partial seizures at this age may be very subtle and hard to diagnose. Generalised-onset seizures also occur, perhaps as a result of diffuse changes with aging or degenerative disease or to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The prognosis for complete seizure control in this population is relatively favourable. Physiological and disease-related changes with aging result in complex pharmacokinetics. Most changes lead to a need for gentler drug treatment with cautious initiation of drugs at lower dosages. Consideration must be given to renal and hepatic function, protein binding and drug interactions. Determinations of free (unbound) drug concentrations are helpful for highly protein bound drugs. The dosages of newer drugs excreted renally must be adjusted based on creatinine clearance. The dosage of most drugs is determined empirically by careful observation of seizure control and adverse effects. Carbamazepine, valproic acid (sodium valproate), gabapentin and lamotrigine have certain theoretical advantages, but comparative trials of anticonvulsants in the elderly are needed. The ideal drug for older patients would be effective, without neurological toxicity, with low protein binding, a nonparticipant in drug interactions and amenable to once daily administration.","Aged, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/etiology, Humans, Incidence, Prevalence",-1

Although there are undoubtedly common issues in the approach to these problems, there are also clear differences. Closer definition of the problem and the development of specific and targeted outcome measures is required. In common with other areas of musculoskeletal rehabilitation, the evidence strongly supports exercise (except possibly in the rare case of true radicular back pain) and a cognitive behavioural approach to pain management. The variability of evidence in support of manipulation suggests that patient selection is important, but as yet those selection criteria are not clear. As is often the case, medical interventions are rarely submitted to evaluation in terms of functional outcome so, for procedures such as epidurals and facet joint injections, the jury is still out at the current time.","Analgesics/therapeutic use, Cognitive Therapy, Exercise Therapy, Humans, Low Back Pain/epidemiology/*rehabilitation, Neck Pain/rehabilitation, Palliative Care, Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation, Treatment Outcome",-1

Towards this end, simultaneous recordings of LV volume (acoustic quantification) and LV pressure (micromanometer) were obtained in 10 such patients before and after drug administration and compared to baseline findings on 10 matched normal controls. The following measurements and calculations were obtained: maximal positive and negative first derivative of LV pressure (peak +dP/dt and peak -dP/dt, respectively), LV minimal and end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic blood pressure, time constant of relaxation (TAU), LV stroke work and LV stiffness constant. The two invasive indexes, LV stiffness constant and TAU classified 10/10 patients as having abnormal LV diastolic function compared with 7/10 patients so classified by Doppler studies. Central sympathetic suppression by a single oral dose of clonidine 0.125 mg in these patients resulted within 60 min in a decrease of heart rate and mean arterial pressure as well as a significant improvement of LV diastolic function indexes. Specifically, the LV stiffness constant (ml(-1)), in normal subjects was 0.0028 vs 0.0152 (P < 0.001) in hypertensive subjects at baseline, vs 0.0053 in hypertensive after clonidine (P < 0.001 vs baseline). Likewise, the E/A ratio, was 1.08 in normal subjects vs 0.88 (P < 0.0001) in hypertensives at baseline, vs 1.28 in hypertensives after clonidine (P < 0.0001 vs baseline). With clonidine the diastolic portion of the pressure-volume curve was displaced downward. In conclusion, clonidine can improve diastolic dysfunction without depressing systolic LV performance. The improvement may be attributable in part to withdrawal of direct sympathetic influence on the myocardium and in part to the indirect effect of systemic, pulmonary and coronary artery relaxation.","Aged, Blood Pressure/*drug effects, Blood Volume/*drug effects, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Diastole/*drug effects, Female, Humans, Hypertension/*drug therapy/ultrasonography, Male, Middle Aged, Sympatholytics/*therapeutic use, Systole/drug effects, Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*drug therapy/ultrasonography, Ventricular Function, Left/*drug effects",-1

Although substantial tone reduction with this treatment has been documented, complications also occur. In this study, we describe the device- and major non-device-related complications in a group of 100 consecutive children and young adults who received 117 intrathecal baclofen pumps for the management of severe spasticity. Twenty-four patients (24%) experienced a total of 48 complications. The most common complication was disconnection of the catheter at its connection to the pump, occurring in 9% of pumps implanted. This complication occurred more frequently in pumps with catheter access ports (16%) than in those without ports (2%). Catheter dislodgement from the intrathecal space was the next most common complication, occurring in 8% of pumps implanted (13% of pumps with ports, 4% of pumps without ports). To decrease the occurrence of the most common complications of intrathecal pumps, we now typically implant pumps without catheter access ports, and we use 2-piece catheters. Although the lack of an access port may be a disadvantage for troubleshooting, most complications can be detected in pumps without a port. Patient and family education is critical in preventing serious consequences of baclofen withdrawal resulting from catheter-related complications.","Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Child, Equipment Design, Equipment Failure, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable/*adverse effects, Infusions, Parenteral/adverse effects, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic, use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Retrospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors",-1

METHODS: CNTF was administered using a drug pump implanted into the lumbar subarachnoid space in each of four patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Escalating doses (0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 4, and 8 micrograms/h) were infused for 48 hours per week in 2-week cycles until the highest tolerated dose was achieved. Patients were observed for side effects, and standardized muscle and respiratory function tests were performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of CNTF were determined using simultaneous lumbar and cervical taps. Plasma and CSF levels of antibodies, CSF cells and protein, and routine blood chemistries were monitored, as were weight and vital signs. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic studies of four patients demonstrated that the distribution and clearance of recombinant human (rH)CNTF are similar to those of many small, water-soluble agents (morphine, baclofen, clonidine) and that the steady-state concentration of rHCNTF at the cervical level was 18 to 36% of that at the lumbar level. Lumbar CSF levels were in the range of 44 to 1230 ng/ml. Intrathecally administered rHCNTF had different adverse effects than the systemically delivered drug. With intrathecal administration, no asthenia, fever, chills, nausea, weight loss, increased cough, or sputum production was found. All patients who received rHCNTF intrathecally experienced dose-related CSF pleocytosis (primarily lymphocytic) and rises in protein levels. No clinical signs of meningeal irritation, such as stiff neck, photophobias, or nausea, were seen. However, one patient who had lumbar spinal stenosis developed severe burning and cramping leg pain. A second patient developed a severe headache and leg and back cramping. No abnormal clinical chemistry or hematological findings were encountered. Plasma levels of rHCNTF were below detection. Antibodies to rHCNTF were found in the systemic circulation of only one patient. The gradual decline in motor strength and performance of standard skills did not improve or worsen. CONCLUSIONS: In this first trial of a recombinant neurotrophic factor to be administered intrathecally by drug pump, the CNTF was well distributed along the spinal canal. Pain syndromes (headache, radicular pain) that were dose-related occurred in two patients, but systemic side effects, which had been observed with subcutaneous rHCNTF, did not occur. Intrathecal drug pump delivery of neurotrophic factors may be the most appropriate way in which to test the efficacy of these high-molecular weight proteins, because high CSF levels can be achieved without significant systemic side effects.","Activities of Daily Living/classification, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/diagnosis/*therapy, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Administration Schedule, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Metabolic Clearance Rate/physiology, Nerve Growth Factors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics, Nerve Tissue Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics, Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics",-1

This improvement is likely related to reduced excitability of alpha-motoneurons. To investigate the influence of baclofen upon the alpha-motoneuron, we analyzed F-waves before and after intrathecal baclofen bolus injection (usually 50 micrograms) as well as after administration of different, constantly delivered doses (60-200 micrograms/day). Intrathecal baclofen bolus decreased the maximum F-wave amplitude (Fp) from an initial value of 9% of the maximum M amplitude (Mmax) (= F/M-ratio) to 2.4% of the Mmax after 130-180 min, reduced the mean F-wave amplitude 60% within 150 min, and shortened the mean duration by 40-60% after 130-180 min. Constantly delivered baclofen of 100 micrograms/day reduced the F/M-ratio from 5% to 2%, the mean F-wave amplitude by 40-80%, and the F-wave mean duration by 40-80%. The minimum F-wave latency did not change after bolus or during steady state administration. The findings indicate that the F-wave mean and maximum amplitude as well as the mean duration are altered in a quantifiable manner following intrathecal baclofen application.","Baclofen/*pharmacology, Electrophysiology, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Injections, Spinal, Motor Neurons/*drug effects, Muscle Spasticity/*physiopathology, Reaction Time",-1

Three Phase I clinical trials were designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose, toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and effects on irradiated tumors and normal tissues. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tirapazamine 9 mg/m2 to 21 mg/m2 was given i.v. 1/2 to 1 h prior to irradiation on a multiple dose schedule of 10 consecutive doses. This was later revised to a three times-per-week schedule for 12 doses. In a second clinical trial, tirapazamine was given in a single dose of 18 mg/m2 to 293 mg/m2 i.v. after irradiation. In a third trial, tirapazamine was administered without irradiation in single doses of 36 mg/m2 to 250 mg/m2, with an option for retreatment. RESULTS: Subjects reported muscle cramping of varying degrees of severity on all three dose schedules. One patient experienced Grade 3 cramping and treatment was discontinued. The most frequent site of cramping were the lower extremities. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) values were elevated in three patients with associated muscle soreness in one patient. MB (cardiac) isoenzymes were elevated in one patient with no evidence of cardiac muscle damage, and returned to baseline at drug completion. No consistent abnormalities in clinical laboratory values were found. Stretching of the muscle was most effective in relieving the cramping. CONCLUSION: Muscle cramping has been the most frequently reported toxicity in Phase I studies of tirapazamine, though it does not appear to be dose limiting. Dose escalation on the three clinical trials continues. In vitro studies to investigate the cramping are ongoing.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*chemically induced, Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy, Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*adverse effects, Triazines/*adverse effects",-1
10970262,Fixation dysfunction with intermittent saccadic intrusions managed by yoked prisms: a case report.,"Weissberg E, Lyons SA, Richman JE",Optometry. 2000 Mar;71(3):183-8.,"BACKGROUND: A 44-year-old woman came to us with a chief symptom of ""jumping letters side-to-side, which is most noticeable while reading."" The onset occurred after she had experienced a closed head traumatic brain injury 3 years earlier. Several neuro-ophthalmologists diagnosed a fixational instability secondary to saccadic intrusions and prescribed Gabapentin, which provided minimal relief. METHODS: The term saccadic intrusions refers to an inappropriate saccade with a disrupting effect on fixation. Our examination revealed a myopic anisometropia. Motility testing confirmed saccadic intrusions that lessened on occlusion of either eye and superior gaze. A plano spectacle with six-prism diopter-yoked base down was used to position the eyes in the superior null point. Electro-oculography, using the Visagraph II, demonstrated pre and post changes with the prism. The uncorrected anisometropia allowed the patient to be monocular under binocular viewing conditions. CASE REPORT: The case report focuses on fixational problems that may occur secondary to traumatic brain injuries. There is evidence that the origin of the problem may be from uninhibited brain stem circuits. Pharmacological treatment may only offer transient improvement. The responsibility of a functional cure is often placed on the optometrist. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates how an alternative use of prism and prescription application can play an important role in the management of fixation dysfunctions.","Accidents, Traffic, Adult, Brain Injuries/complications, *Eyeglasses, Female, Humans, Ocular Motility Disorders/etiology/physiopathology/*therapy, *Saccades, Visual Acuity",-1

Gabapentin was effective in reducing the frequency and severity of muscle cramps and associated sleep disturbances (clinical outcome measures) within the first 2 weeks of medication at 600 mg/d. At the 1 month control (mean dosage, 825 +/- 35 mg), almost every patient had responded to treatment and two thirds experienced a total remission of symptoms. After 3 months of therapy (mean dosage, 892 +/- 180 mg), cramps disappeared in 100% of patients and this benefit persisted as long as 6 months. Additionally, we evaluated in 10 patients the Cramps Threshold Frequency (CTF) (neurophysiological outcome measure) before and during gabapentin treatment. Gabapentin significantly increased the CTF, returning it to normal values. With the limitation of an open-label methodology, our clinical and neurophysiologic experience suggests that a gabapentin dose of 600-1200 mg/d would be helpful in the treatment of muscular cramps.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Aged, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Administration Schedule, Electromyography, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Neurophysiology, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

10871249,The management of multiple sclerosis patients.,"Clanet MG, Brassat D",Curr Opin Neurol. 2000 Jun;13(3):263-70.,"The management of individuals with multiple sclerosis must be considered under the following headings: administration and follow-up of adequate disease-modifying treatment, symptomatic relief and neurorehabilitation. Neurorehabilitation deserves a four-step strategy: multidisciplinary assessment, identification of areas of potential functional improvement, setting of goals of short/long-term duration, and measurement of outcomes. The patient's perspective is important to evaluate through questionnaires about quality of life. Well organized disability services with multidisciplinary specialists are probably cost effective and efficient. Determining the actual economic impact of multiple sclerosis and defining the most cost-effective type of care for persons with multiple sclerosis is a need in all countries faced with the limitation of healthcare resources. In persons with multiple sclerosis the range of main symptoms includes the loss of mobility and spasticity, pain, tremor, abnormal eye movements, paroxysmal symptoms, bladder and bowel dysfunction, sexual disturbances, fatigue and depression. Current palliative treatments, which are reviewed, are partly successful depending on the type of symptoms under consideration.","Humans, *Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/physiopathology/rehabilitation, Prognosis",-1

Recent case studies suggest that its use as an analgesic could be extended to non-cancer pain, especially neuropathic pain. The present case study reports, for the first time, the efficacy of methadone in a burn patient experiencing neuropathic pain in his healed wounds. The patient sustained extensive (55% total body surface area) chemical burns and developed chronic burning sensations, particularly in the lower limbs where skin grafting had been performed. Conventional pharmacotherapies against neuropathic pain were attempted to control pain for over 5 years. The agents used included long- and short-acting opioids, amitriptyline, clonazepam, and gabapentin, but they all failed to relieve the pain. When methadone (5 mg every 12 h) was introduced, it significantly alleviated the patient's pain within a few days of administration. The patient has now been taking methadone (15 mg every 12 h) for 10 months and reports that the opioid caused 70% pain relief and a 55% amelioration in his quality of life. Although these results are based on a case report, they suggest that a switch to methadone might be useful in some burn patients who have developed chronic neuropathic pain unrelieved by conventional pharmacotherapies. Methadone, however, needs to be titrated with vigilance and thus should be administered by a physician experienced with its use in the treatment of chronic pain.","Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Burns/*complications, Chronic Disease, Humans, Leg Injuries/*complications, Male, Methadone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Neuralgia/*drug therapy/*etiology, Quality of Life, Trauma Severity Indices, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHODS: Nineteen patients with FM completed a randomized, double-blind crossover study, which consisted of 4 6-week trials of FL (20 mg), AM (25 mg), a combination of FL and AM, or placebo. Patients were evaluated on the first and last day of each trial period. Outcome measures included a tender point score, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scale, and visual analog scales (VAS) for global well-being (1 completed by the physician and 1 by the patient), pain, sleep trouble, fatigue, and feeling refreshed upon awakening. RESULTS: Both FL and AM were associated with significantly improved scores on the FIQ and on the VAS for pain, global well-being, and sleep disturbances. When combined, the 2 treatments worked better than either medication alone. Similar, but nonsignificant, improvement occurred in the BDI scale, the physician global VAS, and the VAS for fatigue and feeling refreshed upon awakening. Trends were less clear for the tender point score. CONCLUSION: Both FL and AM are effective treatments for FM, and they work better in combination than either medication alone.","Adolescent, Adult, Amitriptyline/*therapeutic use, Analysis of Variance, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy, Fluoxetine/*therapeutic use, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

All charts of outpatients treated with topiramate (n = 76) were reviewed, and clinical response was assessed retrospectively using the Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement. Mild improvement was seen in 47% (n = 36) and moderate-to-marked improvement in 13% (n = 10). Responders received a higher mean dose (180 mg/day) than did nonresponders (83.2 mg/day, p = 0.002). Topiramate dose was also higher in those who lost weight (138.3 mg/day) than in those who did not (70 mg/day, p = 0.007). Weight loss was experienced by 50% of the sample, with a mean loss of 14.2 lbs. Side effects were reported by 82% (n = 62) of the population, including cognitive effects, sedation, parasthesias, nausea, insomnia, headache, and dizziness. Adverse effects led 36% (n = 27) of the total sample to discontinue treatment with topiramate. Topiramate led to significant weight loss in about half of this bipolar population, while also improving mood symptoms at least mildly in most patients. Topiramate response and weight loss were both dose-related, with efficacy, in particular, associated with higher doses (mean = 180 mg/day) than frequently used in current clinical practice.","Adult, Aged, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Data Collection, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Fructose/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs &, derivatives/*therapeutic use, Humans, Male, Medical Records, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome, Weight Loss",-1
8018300,Adverse effects and drug interactions of clinical importance with antiviral drugs.,Morris DJ,Drug Saf. 1994 Apr;10(4):281-91.,"Most antiviral drugs are nucleoside analogues with potential teratogenic, embryotoxic, carcinogenic and antiproliferative activities. They must be administered with caution during pregnancy, because some are known teratogens (e.g. amantadine) and a similar propensity cannot be entirely excluded for others (e.g. aciclovir). Their adverse effects mostly involve bone marrow depression (e.g. granulocytopenia with ganciclovir, anaemia with zidovudine) or neurotoxicity (e.g. seizures with interferon-alpha, peripheral neuropathy with zalcitabine), although gastrointestinal effects are also seen. Idiosyncratic reactions include didanosine-induced acute pancreatitis. Only inosine pranobex is largely free from toxicity. Idoxuridine must be administered topically, given the severity of its systemic adverse effects. Drug interactions involving antiviral agents mostly reflect shared toxicity with other agents (e.g. neutropenia with ganciclovir and zidovudine, pancreatitis with didanosine and alcohol), although renal excretion or hepatic metabolism may be implicated. Given the possibility of severe adverse reactions and drug interactions, antiviral chemotherapy should only be used for potentially serious virus infections. Topical administration avoids systemic adverse effects but not mutagenic risks, and may result in exposure of individuals other than the patient (e.g. aerosolised ribavirin).","AIDS-Related Opportunistic Infections/drug therapy, Acyclovir/adverse effects, Amantadine/adverse effects, Antiviral Agents/*adverse effects, Didanosine/adverse effects, Drug Interactions, Foscarnet/adverse effects, Ganciclovir/adverse effects, Humans, Interferon-alpha/adverse effects, Ribavirin/adverse effects, Rimantadine/adverse effects, Vidarabine/adverse effects, Zalcitabine/adverse effects, Zidovudine/adverse effects",-1

Gabapentin was designed as a lipophilic GABA analog and was first synthesized as a potential anticonvulsant and was launched in 1994 as add-on therapy for the treatment of epilepsy. In this review the discovery and development of gabapentin as an anticonvulsant are discussed. During human trials and while in clinical use, it became apparent that gabapentin induced some other potentially useful therapeutic effects in chronic pain states and behavioral disorders. A review of animal and clinical data relating to these other potential therapeutic utilities is presented. Pregabalin was identified after an investigation into other 3-substituted GABA analogs. It has since been shown to have a similar pharmacological profile to gabapentin with greater potency in preclinical models of pain and epilepsy. Studies of the mechanism(s) of action of these compounds are discussed.

Patients (n = 10) received phenytoin loading doses (15-20 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance regimen (7 mg/kg/day) initiated within 12 hours of the loading dose. Phenytoin serum concentrations were measured serially on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 at 1, 6, and 12 hours. Time-invariant and time-variant Michaelis-Menten pharmacokinetic models were fit to the unbound phenytoin concentration-time data (ADAPT II). Albumin concentrations significantly decreased over time (p < 0.001) and were predictive of the phenytoin binding ratio (r2 = 0.373, p < 0.0001). The time-variant model provided a superior fit of the data in 7 patients with no difference between models in 3 patients. Rapid inhibition of metabolism (Vmaxbaseline = 2.82 +/- 2.35 mg/kg/day) was observed initially following injury. This was followed by induction of metabolism as reflected by a Vmaxinduced of 20.79 +/- 13.71 mg/kg/day, which was approximately twofold higher than reported values for nonstressed children.

Emergency physicians will likely treat patients with baclofen withdrawal or overdose as this treatment becomes more widespread. The syndrome of baclofen withdrawal presents with altered mental status, fever, tachycardia, hypertension or hypotension, seizures, and rebound spasticity, and may be fatal if not treated appropriately. Baclofen withdrawal may mimic other diseases including sepsis, meningitis, autonomic dysreflexia, malignant hyperthermia, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

12137404,Cannabinoids in the treatment of pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis.,Smith PF,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2002 Jun;3(6):859-64.,"There is a large amount of evidence to support the view that the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC), and cannabinoids in general, can reduce muscle spasticity and pain under some circumstances. Cannabinoid (CB1) receptors in the CNS appear to mediate both of these effects and endogenous cannabinoids may fulfil these functions to some extent under normal circumstances. However, in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), it is still questionable whether cannabinoids are superior to existing, conventional medicationsfor the treatment of spasticity and pain. In the case of spasticity, there are too few controlled clinical trials to draw any reliable conclusion at this stage. In the case of pain, most of the available trials suggest that cannabinoids are not superior to existing treatments; however, few trials have examined chronic pain syndromes that are relevant to MS. Whether or not cannabinoids do have therapeutic potential in the treatment of MS, a further issue will be whether synthetic cannabinoids should be used in preference to cannabis itself. Smoking cannabis is associated with significant risks of lung cancer and other respiratory dysfunction. Furthermore, delta9-THC, as a broad-spectrum cannabinoid receptor agonist, will activate both CB1 and CB2 receptors. Synthetic cannabinoids, which target specific cannabinoid receptor subtypes in specific parts of the CNS, are likely to be of more therapeutic use than delta9-THC itself. If rapid absorption is necessary, such synthetic drugs could be delivered via aerosol formulations.","Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*therapeutic use, Animals, Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators, Cannabinoids/*therapeutic use, Cannabis, Disease Models, Animal, Dronabinol/therapeutic use, Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/therapeutic use, Humans, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Muscle Weakness/drug therapy/etiology, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Receptors, Cannabinoid, Receptors, Drug/agonists, Spasm/*drug therapy/etiology",-1

Quinine plus tetracycline is considered the standard treatment for the highly drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum found in this area. Fifty patients received mefloquine (750 mg given immediately, followed by 500 mg 6 h later) with tetracycline and 52 patients received quinine (600 mg every 8 h for seven days) with tetracycline. Tetracycline was administered to both groups in doses of 250 mg four times daily. All patients were admitted to the hospital for 28 days to exclude re-infection. Ninety-three patients completed the study; nine patients left prior to completion of follow-up for reasons unrelated to their treatment. Cure rates for the two groups were 94% (44/47) for mefloquine plus tetracycline and 98% (45/46) for quinine plus tetracycline. Parasite and fever clearance times were shorter for the group treated with mefloquine but the differences were not statistically significant. Nearly all patients (94%) treated with quinine developed cinchonism compared with only 12% treated with mefloquine; all other symptoms following treatment were similar. Thirteen patients (26%) treated with quinine also developed delayed primary attacks of P. vivax during the follow-up period; none developed in the patients treated with mefloquine. These results support the contention that the combination of mefloquine plus tetracycline is equally effective and less toxic than quinine plus tetracycline for treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in areas requiring combination therapy for drug resistance.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Animals, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum/*drug therapy, Male, Mefloquine/*administration & dosage, Middle Aged, Plasmodium falciparum/isolation & purification, Quinine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Tetracycline/*administration & dosage",-1

Focus on flunarizine, fosphenytoin, midazolam and stiripentol.","Bebin M, Bleck TP",Drugs. 1994 Aug;48(2):153-71.,"In the past decade, several new antiepileptic drugs have been tested. Most recently, 5 new antiepileptic drugs have been launched onto European and US markets. These include vigabatrin, oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine in Europe, and felbamate and gabapentin in the US. In addition to these, 3 additional drugs are in the clinical investigational stage: flunarizine, fosphenytoin and stiripentol. A fourth agent is midazolam, which was originally introduced in 1986, but recently has shown effectiveness in the treatment of status epilepticus. Flunarizine is a selective calcium channel blocker that has shown anticonvulsant properties in both animal and human studies. It is a long-acting anticonvulsant that clinical studies have shown to have effects similar to those of phenytoin and carbamazepine in the treatment of partial, complex partial and generalised seizures. Fosphenytoin was developed to eliminate the poor aqueous solubility and irritant properties of intravenous phenytoin. It is rapidly converted to phenytoin after intravenous or intramuscular administration. In clinical studies, this prodrug showed minimal evidence of adverse events and no serious cardiovascular or respiratory adverse reactions. It may have a clear advantage over the present parenteral formulation of phenytoin. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that is more potent than diazepam as a sedative, muscle relaxant and in its influence on electroencephalographic measures. It has been shown to be an effective treatment for refractory seizures in status epilepticus. Stiripentol has anticonvulsant properties as well as the ability to inhibit the cytochrome P450 system. There are significant metabolic drug interactions between stiripentol and phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (phenobarbitone). Stiripentol has been studied in patients with partial seizures, refractory epilepsy and refractory absence seizures with some efficacious results.","Adolescent, Adult, Animals, Anticonvulsants/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Over Studies, Dioxolanes/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Flunarizine/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Humans, Midazolam/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Phenytoin/analogs &, derivatives/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Pilot Projects, Prodrugs",-1
7527324,Pharmacological management of back pain syndromes.,"Porter RW, Ralston SH",Drugs. 1994 Aug;48(2):189-98.,"The symptom of back pain may be the result of many different pathologies. As such, patients with back pain require careful assessment to determine whether the cause is from the spine or other systems. For acute mechanical back pain, treatment is often symptomatic. Symptomatic treatment may include analgesics, anti-inflammatories and/or muscle relaxants. Patients may also need hypnotics in the short term to help them sleep at night. However, drug therapy should be reduced and stopped as soon as possible. Furthermore, too much bedrest may be counterproductive. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the standard treatment for transient back pain. More severe pain may require the addition of an opioid, such as codeine or dextropropoxyphene. Morphine and pethidine (meperidine) may be necessary in patients with back pain due to neoplastic disease or osteoporotic fracture. However, the opioid analgesics are associated with dependence, tolerance and adverse effects. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have analgesic efficacy comparable with paracetamol. Individual patients respond differently to different NSAIDs, and several agents may have to be tried. Long term therapy with NSAIDs is necessary in diseases with an inflammatory component such as ankylosing spondylitis. Calcitonin reduces bone resorption and bone blood flow, and has been suggested to have central analgesic effects. As such, it has been used successfully in patients with Paget's disease, osteolytic bone disease and osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates also inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption and may be useful in Paget's disease, osteolytic metastases and osteoporotic fractures. Other drugs which may be useful in relieving back pain associated with specific circumstances include the tricyclic antidepressants, anxiolytics, antiepileptic agents, corticosteroids, colchicine and chymopapain.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Back Pain/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Calcitonin/therapeutic use, Central Nervous System Agents/therapeutic use, Chymopapain/therapeutic use, Diagnosis, Differential, Diphosphonates/therapeutic use, Humans, Pain Measurement",-1

Demographics, seizure type and history, prior anticonvulsant therapy, concomitant anticonvulsant medications, gabapentin dosing, side effects, seizure response, and tolerability data were obtained from 100 consecutive clinical practice patients (47 men and 53 women) treated with gabapentin. All patients had been previously treated with a mean of 2.9 anticonvulsant drugs and were currently taking a mean of 1.75 anticonvulsant drugs. Seventy-two patients experienced a greater than 50% reduction in seizures, and 23 of these patients experienced a greater than 75% reduction; 57 patients continued gabapentin treatment, 5 of whom remain seizure free and side effect free with gabapentin monotherapy. Of the 42 patients discontinuing treatment, 17 had no seizure reduction, 17 had side effects, and 8 had both. One additional patient died. The mean daily dosage for all 100 patients was 2107 mg, and the mean daily dosage for patients who continued gabapentin treatment was 2270 mg. No linear relationship was found between dosage and patient weight. Fifty-two patients had the dosage of at least 1 concomitant anticonvulsant medication reduced, 31 had at least 1 concomitant anticonvulsant medication removed from the regimen, and 9 required a dosage increase of at least 1 anticonvulsant medication. Twenty patients experienced fatigue, which was usually transient after treatment initiation; in 13 patients fatigue was associated with carbamazepine therapy. In addition, 7 patients experienced ataxia (6 of whom were taking concomitant carbamazepine), and 2 experienced weight gain. Patients experiencing side effects resulting in discontinuation were taking a mean daily dose of gabapentin of 1182 mg. The maximum effective and tolerable daily dosage under clinical practice conditions appears to exceed dosages established in clinical trials. The results of our study suggest broader treatment parameters for gabapentin than initially determined in the more restrictive clinical trials conducted during the drug's development.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Seizures/*drug therapy, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

DESIGN: Single case report. SETTING: Delivery, monitoring, and titration of morphine and midazolam in the patient's home by a homecare agency. RESULTS: The use of high dosages of morphine (i.e., 500 mg/h) produced myoclonic spasms in this patient, which in turn resulted in increasing pain. To allow for continuation of effective analgesia and to control the myoclonic spasms, an infusion of midazolam was initiated and titrated. The midazolam infusion allowed for continuation of the morphine dosage and also permitted further dosage escalation. As morphine dosages were further escalated, it was also necessary to increase the midazolam infusion to control additional myoclonic spasms. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a concomitant midazolam infusion with high doses of morphine appears to be safe and is an effective means of controlling morphine-induced myoclonus. If further dosage increase of morphine are necessary in this setting, increases in the midazolam infusion also may be required.","Adolescent, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous, Male, Midazolam/*administration & dosage, Morphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Myoclonus/*chemically induced/*drug therapy",-1
12809957,Efficacy of a low-dose regimen of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride in acute skeletal muscle spasm: results of two placebo-controlled trials.,"Borenstein DG, Korn S",Clin Ther. 2003 Apr;25(4):1056-73.,"BACKGROUND: Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride is a muscle relaxant that is effective in improving muscle spasm, reducing local pain and tenderness, and increasing range of motion in acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Sedation is the most common adverse event associated with its use at the usual dosage of 10 mg TID. Studies in healthy adults suggest that a lower dose may produce less sedation. Because cyclobenzaprine's duration of action is 4 to 6 hours, reducing the dosing frequency to 10 mg BID would create a potentially painful untreated interval between doses. The alternative is administration of a lower dose (eg, 5 or 2.5 mg) TID. OBJECTIVE: These studies were designed to assess the efficacy and tolerability of cyclobenzaprine 2.5, 5, and 10 mg TID compared with placebo in patients with acute musculoskeletal spasm. METHODS: In 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials conducted at primary care centers in the United States, adult patients with acute painful muscle spasm of the lumbar or cervical region were randomly assigned to receive treatment with 2.5, 5, or 10 mg cyclobenzaprine TID or placebo for 7 days (study 1: cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg TID or placebo; study 2: cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg TID or placebo). The primary efficacy measures were patient-rated clinical global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache. Neither study included a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) as an active control. Although physicians frequently prescribe an analgesic or NSAID in addition to cyclobenzaprine, these studies were not designed to assess whether adding cyclobenzaprine provides a benefit over that of an analgesic. RESULTS: One thousand four hundred five patients (737 study 1; 668 study 2), two thirds with low back pain and one third with neck pain, were randomized to treatment. Their mean age was 42 years, and approximately 89% were white. In both studies, patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg had significantly higher mean scores on the primary efficacy measures compared with those receiving placebo (study 1-P</=0.001 cyclobenzaprine 5 and 10 mg vs placebo, all measures at visits 2 and 3; study 2-P</=0.03 cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg vs placebo, relief from starting backache on day 3 only; cyclobenzaprine 5 mg vs placebo, patient-rated clinical global impression of change, medication helpfulness, and relief from starting backache at visit 3 or day 7 only). On day 7, significantly more patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg reported relief compared with placebo recipients (P < 0.05 all cyclobenzaprine groups vs placebo). Onset of relief was apparent within 3 or 4 doses of the 5-mg regimen. In the subanalysis of the proportion of responders in the pooled 5-mg groups who did and did not report somnolence, a meaningful treatment effect was observed on all primary efficacy variables in patients who did not report somnolence, suggesting that efficacy was independent of sedation. Cyclobenzaprine was well tolerated. Somnolence and dry mouth, the most common adverse effects, were mild and dose related. Overall, >/= 1 adverse event was reported in 54.1%, 61.8%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 5 or 10 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 1 and by 43.9%, 55.9%, and 35.4% of patients receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 or 5 mg or placebo, respectively, in study 2. Adverse events were the primary reason for discontinuation of treatment in the cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg groups in both studies. In study 2, ineffectiveness of therapy was the main reason for discontinuation of therapy in the group receiving cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclobenzaprine 2.5 mg TID was not significantly more effective than placebo. The cyclobenzaprine 5- and 10-mg TID regimens were associated with significantly higher mean efficacy scores compared with placebo. Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg TID was as effective as 10 mg TID, and was associated with a lower incidence of sedation.","Acute Disease, Adult, Amitriptyline/*administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Back Pain/drug therapy/etiology, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Muscle, Skeletal/*drug effects, Neck Pain/drug therapy/etiology, Spasm/complications/*drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

It also exhibits antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. During almost 10 years of clinical use, lansoprazole has proved effective and well tolerated in a wide range of acid-related disorders, including gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), duodenal ulcers, gastric ulcers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related ulcers, as well as non-ulcer dyspepsia and acid hypersecretion. It is also used, in combination with antibiotics, for H. pylori eradication. In the above indications, lansoprazole has generally proved to be superior to the histamine H2-receptor antagonists, and is at least as effective as the other currently available proton pump inhibitors.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty patients with established reflux disease were included in this double-blind, randomized, crossover study. Baclofen, 40 mg, or placebo was given as a single dose with a washout period of 4 weeks. Symptoms were assessed by a visual analogue scale. Oesophageal pH was registered for 12 h and analysed for the whole period and for the 0-4-h, 4-8-h, 8-12-h and 2-h post-prandial periods. RESULTS: Baclofen significantly reduced the number of reflux episodes during the 0-4-h (7.9 vs. 16.5, P < 0.0001; post-prandially: 6.0 vs. 11.2, P < 0.0001) and 0-12-h (46.5 vs. 73, P=0.0001; post-prandially: 18.8 vs. 29.3, P < 0.0001) periods.

9061105,Pharmacological approaches other than opioids in chronic non-cancer pain management.,Merskey H,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. 1997 Jan;41(1 Pt 2):187-90.,"Many pains are controlled by non-addictive procedures ranging from exercise to a variety of analgesic medications. Some pains are controlled by analgesic drugs, but at the cost of intolerable side effects. This is true both for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. The worst pains are most often controlled by opioids, but problems of tolerance and addiction limit these successes. This contribution provides a statement on non-addictive, non-opioid drugs which help to control pain. Just as these vary in their success, so they vary also in the strength of the scientific evidence which supports their use. The groups of drugs to be considered can be evaluated in three respects; evidence of analgesic effect in controlled trials; evidence of side-effects compared with control substances and with standard experience; evidence of usefulness in clinical practice. The latter which is the most important for practice often has the least scientific proof. Six main classes of drugs are recognized which provide analgesic effects, other than opioids. 1) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely accepted as analgesics on the basis of animal studies, numerous controlled investigations and clinical practice. Acetaminophene may not be anti-inflammatory, but is recognized as an effective analgesic which in many other respects resembles the above. 2) Muscle relaxants, e.g. cyclobenzaprine or baclofen have varied actions, but often provide some relief of pain. 3) Antidepressants may be analgesic if they relieve depression which is giving rise to pain. This applies to all anti-depressants. Some antidepressants have been shown to be analgesic in the absence of depression. The best accredited of these is amitriptyline. Antidepressants too have significant side effects. A serotoninergic hypothesis is insufficient to explain the actions of antidepressants in relieving pain in the absence of depression. 4) Phenothiazine neuroleptics (and possibly some others) may be analgesic. Drugs reported to be analgesic include chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) among others. Haloperidol has also been utilized. Well controlled evidence exists with the use of methotrimeprazine (levomepromazine) used as an injection. The analgesic effect of oral neuroleptics is less well established and mostly depends upon clinical observation, withdrawal and re-challenge. 5) Anticonvulsants. 6) Other drugs. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and some muscle relaxants, e.g. cyclobenzaprine are best used in the short term. The gastrointestinal side effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been quite troublesome and over 2% of patients followed over five years are at risk of developing peptic ulceration from such medication. Cyclobenzaprine is best used in short term treatment, but may be used intermittently for chronic pain. Antidepressants, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants and some other drugs can be used long term. Topical analgesic agents may also be used.","Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology",-1
8037889,A risk-benefit assessment of vigabatrin in the treatment of neurological disorders.,"Srinivasan J, Richens A",Drug Saf. 1994 May;10(5):395-405.,"Vigabatrin was designed to increase the levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. It does this by replacing GABA as a substrate for the action of the catabolic enzyme GABA-transaminase. As a result of this inhibition, neuronal GABA levels are elevated, resulting in enhanced endogenous GABA transmission. A number of clinical trials assessing the effect of vigabatrin in epilepsy have been completed. Vigabatrin is of proven benefit in partial seizures and secondarily generalised tonic clonic seizures, and it is licensed for use as adjunctive therapy in these conditions in several European countries. It has been shown to be effective in some epilepsy syndromes in children including West's syndrome, infantile spasms and cryptogenic partial seizures. Its effect on primary generalised tonic clonic seizures is variable, while there is considerable evidence that it has a deleterious effect on myoclonic and absence seizures. There have been a few reports of the benefits of vigabatrin in other neurological disorders including tardive dyskinesia, degenerative ataxias and GABA metabolism disorders. The adverse effects associated with vigabatrin are similar to those seen with other anticonvulsants, with a predominance of CNS effects including somnolence, fatigue, irritability, dizziness and headache. Psychiatric symptoms including depression and psychosis are seen in a small number of patients and cause the most problems. These often necessitate discontinuation of vigabatrin, which usually results in resolution of symptoms.","4-Aminobutyrate Transaminase/antagonists & inhibitors, Animals, Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Brain/drug effects/metabolism, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Double-Blind Method, Epilepsy/drug therapy, Humans, Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy, Risk Factors, Single-Blind Method, Vigabatrin, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use",-1

The aim of this study was to assess, by interim analyses, the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent olanzapine in combination with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agent fluoxetine. METHOD: We enrolled 27 patients (17 women [63.0%] and 10 men [37.0%]; mean +/- SD age: 41.2 +/- 14.7 years) with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder with psychotic features into an open trial of olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/day, plus fluoxetine, 20 to 80 mg/day. Patients were assessed at each visit with the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and both the psychotic and mood modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders, Patient Edition. We are reporting the results of the first 6 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-two (81.5%) of the 27 enrolled patients completed the 6-week open trial, and 5 (18.5%) dropped out, with only 2 (7.4%) dropping out due to side effects. Of the 27 patients, 74.1% (N = 20) met criteria for melancholic features, 14.8% (N = 4) had delusions alone, 18.5% (N = 5) had hallucinations alone, and 66.7% (N = 18) reported both delusions and hallucinations. In addition, the overall rates of response for the intent-to-treat group were as follows: depression response rate, 66.7% (N = 18); psychosis response rate, 59.3% (N = 16); psychotic depression response rate, 55.6% (N = 15); and psychotic depression remission rate, 40.7% (N = 11). CONCLUSION: The combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine appears to be a promising, safe, and effective treatment for psychotic depression.

The second part is concerned with the possibility that some interneuronal systems may be responsible for motor disturbances caused by spinal cord injuries and that these interneurones may be defined. This possibility is discussed with respect to the hyperexcitability of alpha-motoneurones and the exaggeration of stretch reflexes in spastic patients. To this end, what is known about cat spinal interneurones and about the neuronal basis and pharmacological treatment of spasticity, is put together. Interneurones in di- and trisynaptic reflex pathways from group II muscle afferents are singled out, since they are depressed by the alpha(2) noradrenaline receptor agonists clonidine and tizanidine, which is a critical feature of interneurones expected to contribute to exaggerated stretch reflexes which are reduced by alpha(2) noradrenaline receptor agonists. Recent observations that reflex excitation of extensor motoneurones from group II afferents is enhanced in spastic patients and that the pathologically strong reflex actions of group II afferents are reduced by clonidine and tizanidine support this proposal. On the other hand, a lack of effect of clonidine and tizanidine upon other types of excitatory or inhibitory interneurones argues against any major contribution of such interneurones to the abnormally strong responses of alpha-motoneurones to muscle stretch.","Animals, Cats, Efferent Pathways/physiology, Humans, Interneurons/*physiology, Reflex/physiology, Spinal Cord/cytology/*physiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/physiopathology",-1

DESIGN: A 2-year follow-up study of an incomplete T12 paraplegic patient, who was reluctant to undergo intrathecal baclofen therapy, presenting severe painful spasms in his lower limbs treated with intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A. SETTING: Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hopital de Gravelone, Sion, Switzerland. SUBJECT: Single patient case report. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Spasticity, spasms and pain measured with the modified Ashworth scale, spasm frequency score and visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Treatment of spasticity with selective intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin type A resulted in subjective and objective improvement. CONCLUSION: Botulinum toxin type A has its place in the treatment of spasticity in spinal cord injury patients. This treatment is expensive and its effect is reversible. It can complement intrathecal baclofen in treating upper limb spasticity in tetraplegic patients. Tolerance does occur to the toxin. Although high doses of the product are well tolerated, the quantity should be tailored to the patient's need. The minimal amount necessary to reach clinical effects should be adhered to and booster doses at short period intervals should be avoided.","Botulinum Toxins, Type A/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Neuromuscular Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Quadriplegia/*complications, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, Treatment Outcome",-1

Which drugs help which patients?,Deyo RA,Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 1996 Dec 15;21(24):2840-9; discussion 2849-50.,"STUDY DESIGN: A brief review of current literature and issues on drug therapy for low back pain. OBJECTIVES: To identify current knowledge and future research needs related to drug therapy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Drug therapy is one of many possible treatment choices for symptom relief in patients with low back pain. The variety of drugs used suggests that there is no uniquely successful form of drug therapy. One reason for uncertainty and slow progress in this area is the limited quality of many clinical trials for back pain, with inadequate description of patients and outcomes being common deficits. METHODS: A selective review of randomized trials and systematic literature syntheses on drug therapy is given. RESULTS: Despite limitations, there is good evidence to support the efficacy of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain and fair evidence for the use of muscle relaxants. There is greater controversy about the use of corticosteroids, which have been administered orally, intramuscularly, and epidurally. There is conflicting evidence regarding epidural injection of corticosteroids, but one meta-analysis suggests they may provide a small symptomatic improvement for patients with radiculopathy. Trials of systemic steroids and antidepressant drugs for managing chronic pain are inconclusive. The only randomized trial of local anesthetic injection into trigger points suggested that this treatment was equivalent to that of saline injection, needling without injection, or vapo-coolant spray alone. CONCLUSION: It seems reasonable to recommend acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for patients with acute back pain, with efforts to minimize costs and complications. Muscle relaxants and narcotic analgesics may be appropriate for some patients, but selection criteria are unclear, and these drugs should be prescribed for fixed periods. Drug treatment for chronic low back pain is less clear, and a current controversy centers on the use of chronic narcotic analgesics for such patients. Future research should include evaluating combinations of medications, combinations of medication and physical therapy, systemic corticosteroid therapy, trigger point injections, and narcotic use for patients with chronic pain. Spinal stenosis is common in the older population, and more drug trials are needed for this condition.","Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Colchicine/therapeutic use, Humans, Low Back Pain/*drug therapy/rehabilitation, Neuromuscular Depolarizing Agents/therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1

Its lack of both anticholinergic side effects and interference with the metabolism of drugs via the cytochrome P450 pathway make it especially useful for transplant recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We describe the case of a renal transplant recipient with a long-term stable functioning allograft who developed reversible acute renal dysfunction after beginning gabapentin therapy for chronic pain due to diabetic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that gabapentin may cause acute renal dysfunction by a mechanism involving renal afferent vasoconstriction. Caution should be employed when considering the use of gabapentin in transplant recipients, especially when combined with other agents that may potentiate renal vasoconstriction.","Acetates/*adverse effects, Acute Disease, Adult, *Amines, Analgesics/*adverse effects, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Female, Humans, Kidney/*drug effects, Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
7732079,The effects of intrathecally administered baclofen on function in patients with spasticity.,"Campbell SK, Almeida GL, Penn RD, Corcos DM",Phys Ther. 1995 May;75(5):352-62.,"The purpose of this article is to review the literature on the effects of intrathecally administered baclofen on impairment in spasticity and muscle activation patterns, on functional limitations in mobility and self-care, and on disability in daily life roles.

Improved ability to accomplish transfers, self-care, and locomotion is less consistently studied but has also been reported in about 60% to 70% of patients. Evidence of improved quality of life is primarily anecdotal but may be found in 10% to 30% of patients. We conclude that research protocols should be developed to clarify effects on control of voluntary movement, functional limitations, and quality of life.","Activities of Daily Living, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects",-1

CASE SUMMARY: Six patients with major depression or double depression (major depression and dysthymia) who were partially responsive to lithium and SSRI treatment were given either bupropion or desipramine, in an open clinical manner. Improvement was determined and rated by a psychiatrist based on clinical judgment guided by the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement scale and by the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) as described in Axis V in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. RESULTS: Among the 6 depressed patients with partial remission (much improved in symptoms and moderate functional improvement: CGI score 2, GAF score 51-60) while taking the SSRI and lithium combination, 2 showed complete remission (very much improved in symptoms and good functioning: CGI 1, GAF 80-100) and 3 achieved near-complete remission (very much improved in symptoms and significant functional recovery: CGI 1, GAF 61-80) when given either bupropion or desipramine. One patient did not show any additional clinical or functional improvement. Second-line augmentation with bupropion was better tolerated than desipramine. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical observation suggests that second-line augmentation with NAs may be a viable option to optimize recovery in depressed patients with a partial response to lithium augmentation of SSRIs.","Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Adult, Depression/*drug therapy/psychology, Drug Resistance, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Lithium/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

14518529,Early use of intrathecal baclofen in brain injury in pediatric patients.,Turner MS,Acta Neurochir Suppl. 2003;87:81-3.,"BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of intrathecal Baclofen for spasticity from traumatic brain injury in June of 1996 based on a Phase III clinical trial that documented efficacy in patients one year post injury. The FDA approval is only for patients who are one year post injury based on the Phase III study. We have found use of ITB in the first few months after injury very effective in a subgroup of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) pediatric patients with spasticity, dystonia and autonomic storming following brain injury. METHOD: The author's database of over 250 patients receiving intrathecal baclofen was reviewed. Retrospective chart review was undertaken of the 6 patients identified with brain injuries over a three year period that were given ITB less than one year post injury. The patients' diagnosis included asphyxia, traumatic brain injury and stroke. The ages were one year to fourteen years of age. ITB was offered after all conventional therapy had been exhausted and the patient's spasticity remained intractable. These patients also all experienced autonomic dysfunction with severe autonomic storms. FINDINGS: All of the patients had a decrease in their spasticity of at least 2 points on the Ashworth score. The autonomic storms ceased in all 6 patients when adequate dosages of ITB were reached. The patients could be weaned from all oral and intravenous medications for tone, storming and fever. Many of the patients became much more alert and interactive when the medications were stopped. Five of the six are still using their pump for their tone one to five years post implant, the sixth had the pump stopped at the parents' request for religious reasons.

Epub 2002 May 7.,"Patients' and caregivers' fear of addiction to and concern about side effects of morphine have been found to be among the major barriers to adequate pain relief in cancer patients. In contrast, the transdermal administration of opioids by means of fentanyl patches does not seem to evoke such fears. In a qualitative study, 60 patients in our outpatient pain clinic recorded up to five associations with a list of diseases, drugs and administration routes. Cancer and AIDS were associated most often with death, followed by suffering, anxiety and hopelessness. Migraine was associated predominantly with pain and other physical symptoms. Aspirin was associated less with pain in general than with headache and, sometimes, specifically with alcohol or hangover. Morphine was associated predominantly with pain and pain relief, but fears of intoxication, abuse and addiction and concerns about side effects were frequently named. Major differences were evident from the associations with the different routes of administration. The word 'pill' was mostly associated with contraception. Associations with 'tablets' were more pharmacological in nature, and side effects were frequently named. Patches were associated with wounds, cuts, bruises, and blisters and with protection. Some associations with patches were related to comfort. Injections and infusions were associated with physicians or the hospital environment. In conclusion, patients expressed major differences in their perceptions of the different drugs and routes of administration.

The mechanism whereby ITB alleviates increased skeletal muscle tone is generally accepted; however, less is known about its effect on smooth muscles. The authors present two patients who developed a paralytic ileus during ITB infusion for supraspinal spasticity. In addition, they performed a retrospective chart analysis of another 12 patients receiving ITB with respect to their intestinal function. They calculated the cumulative sum of days without bowel movements plus the cumulative sum of interventions intended to promote intestinal peristalsis before and during ITB treatment. Intestinal function deteriorated in 10, remained unchanged in one, and improved in three patients compared to baseline, irrespective of concomitant oral baclofen medication. This is the first study addressing a previously unnoticed, but potentially deleterious side effect of ITB treatment. The findings suggest, however, that close observation of intestinal activity in conjunction with the generous use of prokinetic, laxantic or eubiotic drugs may allow for continuation of ITB treatment, even in particularly sensitive patients.","Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacology, Digestive System/*drug effects/*physiopathology, Female, Gastrointestinal Diseases/*chemically induced/*physiopathology, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacology",-1

The study medications were all safe and well tolerated after all treatments. Neither the pharmacokinetics of lumefantrine nor the pharmacokinetics of quinine was influenced by the presence of the other drug. Plasma levels of artemether and dihydroartemisinin appeared to be lower following the combined treatment Riamet + quinine, but this was not considered to be clinically relevant. Riamet alone had no effect on QTc interval. Infusion of quinine alone caused a transient prolongation of QTc interval, which was consistent with the known cardiotoxicity of quinine, with this effect being slightly but significantly greater when quinine was infused after Riamet. It would thus appear that the inherent risk of QTc prolongation of IV quinine was enhanced by prior administration of Riamet. However, these occasional QTc prolongations, which were small in magnitude and not correlated with plasma concentrations of any of the compounds, were not considered to be of clinical importance. In conclusion, overlapping therapy with artemether-lumefantrine and IV quinine in the treatment of patients with complicated or multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria may result in a modest increased risk of QTc prolongation, but this is far outweighed by the potential therapeutic benefit.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Antimalarials/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Artemisinins/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Drug Combinations, Drug Interactions, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Electrocardiography/drug effects, Ethanolamines/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Fluorenes/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous, Male, Middle Aged, Quinine/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Sesquiterpenes/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics",-1

11225532,Quinine induced coagulopathy--a near fatal experience.,"Hawthorne M, Sim R, Acton CH",Aust Dent J. 2000 Dec;45(4):282-4.,"A 67 year old man presented to his local dentist for restorative treatment. He stated he was fit and well and denied taking any medications. When he was given an inferior alveolar nerve block, excessive bleeding was noted at the injection site and the dentist advised the patient see an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. An appointment was made for the patient but he did not attend. Three days later, he presented with evidence of massive deep haemorrhage to the point of airway compromise. He underwent hospital admission, early intubation, intensive care for nine days and hospitalization for six weeks. The cause of his bleeding was a severe thrombocytopoaenia, induced by chronic ingestion of quinine. He was self-medicating with this to relieve muscular cramps. Despite this experience, the patient continued to deny that quinine was the cause of his problem and that he had failed in his obligations to advise the dentist of his drug history. Dentists need to be alert to the risk that patients may not reveal their true medical history. There are, however, obligations on the dentist to ensure the accuracy of information the patient gives and to ensure that patients whom they believe are at risk follow their advice. Teamwork and skillful airway management prevented this patient's demise.","Aged, Anesthesia, Dental, Dentist-Patient Relations, Hematoma/etiology, Humans, Male, Mandibular Nerve, Mouth Floor/pathology, Muscle Cramp/drug therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects, Nerve Block, Oral Hemorrhage/etiology, Quinine/*adverse effects, Self Medication/adverse effects, Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced, Tongue Diseases/etiology",-1
12027784,SUNCT Syndrome: diagnosis and treatment.,"Pareja JA, Caminero AB, Sjaastad O",CNS Drugs. 2002;16(6):373-83.,"Short-lasting Unilateral Neuralgiform headache attacks with Conjunctival injection and Tearing (SUNCT) is a syndrome predominant in males, with a mean age of onset around 50 years. The attacks are strictly unilateral, generally with the pain persistently confined to the ocular/periocular area. Most attacks are moderate to severe in intensity and burning, stabbing or electrical in character. The mean duration of paroxysms is 1 minute, with a usual range of 10 to 120 seconds (total range 5 to 250 seconds). Prominent, ipsilateral conjunctival injection and lacrimation regularly accompany the attacks. Nasal stuffiness/rhinorrhoea are frequently noted. In addition, there is subclinical forehead sweating. During attacks, there is increased intraocular pressure on the symptomatic side and swelling of the eyelids. No changes in pupil diameter have been observed. Attacks can be triggered mostly from trigeminally innervated areas, but also from the extratrigeminal territory. There are also spontaneous attacks. An irregular temporal pattern is the rule, with symptomatic periods alternating with remissions in an unpredictable fashion. During active periods, the frequency of attacks may vary from <1 attack/day to >30 attacks/hour. The attacks predominate during the daytime, nocturnal attacks being seldom reported. A SUNCT-like picture has been described in some patients with either intra-axial or extra-axial posterior fossa lesions, mostly vascular disturbances/ malformations. In the vast majority of patients, however, aetiology and pathogenesis are unknown. In SUNCT syndrome, there is a lack of persistent, convincingly beneficial effect of drugs or anaesthetic blockades that are generally effective in cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, trigeminal neuralgia, idiopathic stabbing headache ('jabs and jolts syndrome'), and other headaches more faintly resembling SUNCT syndrome. Single reports have claimed that carbamazepine, lamotrigine, gabapentin, corticosteroids or surgical procedures may be of help. However, caution is recommended when assessing any therapy in a disorder such as SUNCT syndrome, in which the rather chaotic and unpredictable temporal pattern makes the assessment of any drug/therapeutic effect per se a particularly difficult matter.","Anesthetics, Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Cluster Headache/diagnosis, Conjunctival Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy, Diagnosis, Differential, Drug Resistance, Headache Disorders/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy, Humans, Nerve Block/methods, Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/methods, Psychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use, Sex Factors, Syndrome, Treatment Outcome, Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use",-1

The clinical diagnosis of basilar artery occlusion is often difficult because the initial neurologic findings, most frequently hemiparesis, involuntary movements, or headache, are often transient and can suggest complicated migraine, seizures, or both. We have reviewed 37 previously reported pediatric cases of basilar artery occlusion and present 3 additional ones. In the 40 cases, basilar artery occlusion alone occurred in 22; in the other 18, there was accompanying vertebral artery occlusion. In the cases of pure basilar artery occlusion, the most common causes were trauma and arteritis, but in most such cases, the etiology could not be determined. The cause was found much more often in cases of basilar artery occlusion with accompanying vertebral artery occlusion, with trauma being the most frequent etiology, especially in boys between 6 and 14 years. Of the 37 previously reported pediatric cases of basilar artery occlusion, 7 were ""locked in"" early in the course (mute, quadriparetic, aware, and communicative with eye movements), as were our 3 cases. In most cases of basilar artery occlusion that are locked in, the basilar artery occlusion involves its midportion, sparing the anterior inferior cerebellar and superior cerebellar arteries.","Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Communication, Diagnosis, Differential, Eye Movements, Humans, Infant, Male, *Muscle Contraction, Mutism/etiology, Quadriplegia/etiology, Retrospective Studies, Syndrome, Vertebral Artery/pathology, Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency/*complications/*diagnosis/pathology",-1

These compounds include the original GYKI-52466, its more potent derivative GYKI 53655 and the active isomer of the latter, GYKI 53784. This review summarizes current knowledge of this novel AMPA antagonist: GYKI 53784. GYKI 53784 is the most potent of the compounds in the 2,3-benzodiazepine class, blocking AMPA receptor-mediated responses. In contrast to the compounds of the quinoxalinedione family, that block AMPA as well as kainate receptors, GYKI 53784 does not block the activation of kainate receptors. Furthermore, GYKI 53784 does not act at the same receptor site as positive AMPA modulators (i.e., cyclothiazide, BDP-12, 1-BCP or aniracetam). GYKI 53784 is a powerful neuroprotective agent in both in vitro and in vivo models of AMPA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity. In contrast to NMDA receptor antagonists, whose favorable clinical actions are compromised by important side effects such as the impairment of memory functions, the selective AMPA antagonist, GYKI 53784, may be of potential clinical value, both in acute (stroke and trauma) and chronic (Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy) neurological disorders.","Action Potentials/drug effects, Allosteric Regulation, Animals, Benzodiazepines/chemistry/*pharmacology, Binding, Competitive, Cochlear Nerve/drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Interactions, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology, Microscopy, Electron, Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology, Receptors, AMPA/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism, Receptors, Kainic Acid/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism, Structure-Activity Relationship, Synaptic Transmission/drug effects",-1

Babesia microti (in the United States) and bovine strains (in Europe) cause most infections in humans. Most cases are tick-borne, although cases of transfusion-associated and transplacental/perinatal transmission have also been reported. Factors associated with more severe disease include advanced age, previous splenectomy and immunodeficient states. Symptoms include high fever, chills, diaphoresis, weakness, anorexia and headache. Later in the course of the illness, the patient may develop jaundice. Congestive heart failure, renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome are the most common complications. Therapy using the combination of quinine sulfate and clindamycin was the most commonly used treatment; however, atovaquone suspension plus azithromycin was recently reported an equally effective and less toxic therapy.

The diagnosis of cluster headache was confirmed by direct observation of a typical attack. Despite efforts at prophylaxis, the patient continued to experience three to four severe headaches per day. Attempts to control his headaches with scheduled parenteral dihydroergotamine were successful, but headaches recurred when the medication was tapered, and continuous or intermittent use of parenteral dihydroergotamine was not felt to be a practical option for the patient. Naratriptan 2.5 mg twice daily completely abolished his headaches, which recurred when the medication was discontinued.

14592300,Melatonin for treatment of REM sleep behavior disorder in neurologic disorders: results in 14 patients.,"Boeve BF, Silber MH, Ferman TJ",Sleep Med. 2003 Jul;4(4):281-4.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the treatment response with melatonin for rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) associated with other neurologic disorders. BACKGROUND: Clonazepam has been considered the treatment of choice for RBD. However, an alternative treatment is desirable for those with RBD refractory to clonazepam, for those who experience intolerable side-effects with clonazepam, and for those in whom clonazepam precipitates or aggravates obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). To date, there is minimal published data and limited follow-up regarding the use of melatonin for patients with RBD associated with other neurologic syndromes and disorders. DESIGN/METHODS: The response to melatonin treatment for RBD was reviewed on consecutive patients the investigators treated with this agent at Mayo Clinic Rochester from January 2000 to June 2001. The coexisting neurologic disorders, reasons for using melatonin, effective doses, side-effects, and duration of follow-up were also reviewed on all patients. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were commenced on melatonin over the specified time period (13 male, median RBD onset age 56 years, range 20-77 years). The coexisting neurologic findings/disorders were dementia with Lewy bodies (n=7), mild cognitive impairment with mild parkinsonism (n=2), multiple system atrophy (n=2), narcolepsy (n=2), and Parkinson's disease (n=1). The reasons for using melatonin in these cases were incomplete response of RBD to clonazepam in six patients, existing cognitive impairment in five, intolerable side-effects with clonazepam in two, and presence of severe obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy in one. With seven patients continuing to use clonazepam at 0.5-1.0 mg/night, RBD was controlled in six patients, significantly improved in four, and initially improved but subsequently returned in two; no improvement occurred in one patient and increased RBD frequency/severity occurred in one patient. The effective melatonin doses were 3 mg in two cases, 6 mg in seven cases, 9 mg in one case, and 12 mg in two cases. Five patients reported side-effects, which included morning headaches (2), morning sleepiness (2), and delusions/hallucinations (1); these symptoms resolved with decreased dosage. The mean duration of follow-up was 14 months (range 9-25 months), with eight patients experiencing continued benefit with melatonin beyond 12 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In this series, persistent benefit with melatonin beyond 1 year of therapy occurred in most but not all patients. Melatonin can be considered as a possible sole or add-on therapy in select patients with RBD. Prospective, long-term, controlled trials with melatonin are warranted in a larger number of patients with RBD associated with a variety of neurologic symptoms and disorders.","Adult, Aged, Clonazepam/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Resistance, Female, Humans, Male, Melatonin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Nervous System Diseases/*complications, REM Sleep Behavior Disorder/*drug therapy/*etiology",-1

METHODS: Stroke patients with >6 months of intractable spasticity were screened via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design of either intrathecal normal saline or 50 microgram baclofen. Those who dropped an average of 2 points in either their affected lower extremity side Ashworth or Penn spasm frequency scores were then offered computer-controlled pump implantation for continuous ITB and followed prospectively for up to 12 months. RESULTS: In 21 stroke patients 6 hours after the active drug bolus, the average (+/-SD) lower extremity Ashworth score on the affected extremities decreased from 3.3+/-1.2 to 1.4+/-0.7 (P<0.0001), spasm score from 1.2+/-1.2 to 0.1+/-0.3 (P=0.0224), and reflex score from 2.1+/-1.2 to 0.1+/-0.5 (P<0.0001). The average upper extremity Ashworth score on the affected extremities decreased from 2.8+/-1.1 to 1.8+/-0.8 (P<0.0001), spasm score from 0.7+/-1.0 to 0.2+/-0.4 (P=0.1544), and reflex score from 2.1+/-0.9 to 1.2+/-0.9 (P=0.0004). All active drug scores were statistically different from placebo scores at 6 hours (P<0.05). With up to 12 months of continuous infusion of ITB in 17 implanted patients, the average lower extremity Ashworth score on the affected extremities decreased from 3.7+/-1.0 to 1.8+/-1.1 (P<0.0001), the spasm score dropped from 1.2+/-1.3 to 0.6+/-1.0 (P=0.4282), and the reflex score decreased from 2.4+/-1.3 to 1.0+/-1.3 (P<0.0001). The average upper extremity Ashworth score in the affected extremities decreased from 3.2+/-1.1 to 1.8+/-0.9 (P<0.0001), the spasm score dropped from 0.7+/-1.0 to 0.3+/-0.8 (P=0.8685), and the reflex score decreased from 2.4+/-0.8 to 1.5+/-1.2 (P=0.3337). The average continuous ITB dose required to attain these effects was 268 microgram/d.

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using efficacy data from three recent, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials of antiepileptic drugs studied for migraine prevention and cost data. Two measures of cost-effectiveness were used: cost per headache prevented and the cost-equivalent number. RESULTS: In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trials evaluated, three antiepileptic drugs were shown to be effective in migraine prevention. All three antiepileptic drugs had high costs per migraine reduced. Gabapentin was the most costly at dollars 138.00 per migraine prevented, whereas the cost per migraine prevented with topiramate was US dollars 114.80 and with divalproex sodium was US dollars 48.00. For migraine prevention divalproex sodium became cost-effective with 10 migraines per month, whereas gabapentin and topiramate required considerably more migraines per month to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Antiepileptic drugs have proven effectiveness in migraine prophylaxis. However, in patients responsive to their acute care medications, the antiepileptic drugs are only cost-effective for those patients with a high frequency of migraines and those with comorbid diseases. Future studies should be done with antiepileptic drugs in patients exhibiting a migraine frequency of 10 or more headaches per month.","Acetates/economics/therapeutic use, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/economics/*therapeutic use, Cost-Benefit Analysis, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Fructose/*analogs & derivatives/economics/therapeutic use, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy/economics, Models, Theoretical, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/economics/therapeutic use, Sumatriptan/economics/therapeutic use, Valproic Acid/economics/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

METHODS: Enrollment in this prospective expanded pilot study was limited to adult patients with severely disabling, medically refractory non-DYT1 generalized dystonia or choreoathetosis. Six consecutive patients underwent follow-up examinations at defined intervals of 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postsurgery. There were five women and one man, and their mean age at surgery was 45.5 years. Formal assessments included both the Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia scale and the recently developed Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. Two patients had primary generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and four suffered from choreoathetosis secondary to infantile cerebral palsy. Bilateral quadripolar DBS electrodes were implanted in all instances, except in one patient with markedly asymmetrical symptoms. There were no adverse events related to surgery. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in the two patients with generalized dystonia improved by 78 and 71% at 3 months, by 82 and 69% at 1 year, and by 78 and 70% at 2 years postoperatively. This was paralleled by marked amelioration of disability scores. The mean improvement in Burke-Fahn-Marsden scores in patients with choreoathetosis was 12% at 3 months, 29% at 1 year, and 23% at 2 years postoperatively, which was not significant. Two of these patients thought that they had achieved marked improvement at 2 years postoperatively, although results of objective evaluations were less impressive. In these two patients there was a minor but stable improvement in disability scores. All patients had an improvement in pain scores at the 2-year follow-up review. Medication was tapered off in both patients with generalized dystonia and reduced in two of the patients with choreoathetosis. All stimulation-induced side effects were reversible on adjustment of the DBS settings. Energy consumption of the batteries was considerably higher than in patients with Parkinson disease. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pallidal DBS is a safe and effective procedure in generalized non-DYT1 dystonia, and it may become the procedure of choice in patients with medically refractory dystonia. Postoperative improvement of choreoathetosis is more modest and varied, and subjective ratings of outcome may exceed objective evaluations.","Adult, Athetosis/surgery/*therapy, Carrier Proteins/genetics, Chorea/surgery/*therapy, Dystonia/genetics/surgery/*therapy, Electric Stimulation Therapy/*instrumentation, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Gene Expression/genetics, Globus Pallidus/*physiopathology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, *Molecular Chaperones, *Neurosurgical Procedures/methods, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies",-1

Prior to pump implantation, a baclofen bolus test (BBT) is used to assess the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen using the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) and Penn Spasm Frequency Scales (SFS). The result of a BBT may be difficult to interpret in patients with reduced joint mobility caused by contractures. The aim of this study was to apply a new spasticity measurement which would quantify and visualise the effect of a BBT in 10 patients with severe cerebral spasticity and contractures. Spasticity was recorded continuously by the measurement of force under circular fibreglass casts in 10 knee joint contractures. Force was recorded as net-torque by multiplying the force and distance between sensor and joint axis, thus allowing inter-individual comparison. MAS, SFS, and two three-hour time integrals of net-torque were determined before and after intrathecally administered baclofen. No significant changes in MAS (p = 0.1) and SFS (p = 0.07) were observed; however, a significant reduction of time integrals of net-torque after baclofen administration (p = 0.005) was found. The present study shows that the antispastic effect of intrathecally administered BBT can be quantitatively assessed and visualised using the described method. It also suggests that this method can be helpful in the assessment of the effectiveness of the BBT in patients with severe spasticity of cerebral origin and contractures.","Adult, Baclofen/*diagnostic use/*therapeutic use, *Casts, Surgical/statistics & numerical data, Electromyography/methods/statistics & numerical data, Female, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Pressure, Reproducibility of Results, Statistics, Nonparametric",-1

Baclofen overdose can lead to coma, respiratory depression, hyporeflexia, and flaccidity. An abrupt decrease in the dose of baclofen due to surgery or a rapid tapering program may result in severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome manifesting hallucinations, delirium, seizures, and high fever. Severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome secondary to intentional overdose, however, has not received mention. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old male receiving chronic baclofen therapy, 20 mg/d, attempted suicide by ingesting at least 800 mg of baclofen. He was found in coma 2 hours postingestion with depressed respirations, areflexia, hypotonia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Treatment with intravenous fluids, atropine, dopamine, and hemodialysis was associated with restoration of consciousness within 2 days but disorientation, hallucinations, fever, delirium, hypotension, bradycardia, and coma developed during the following week. Baclofen withdrawal syndrome was not diagnosed until hospital day 9, when reinstitution of baclofen rapidly stabilized his condition. Oral overdosage of baclofen causes severe neurological and cardiovascular manifestations due to its GABA and dominant cholinergic effects. Severe baclofen withdrawal syndrome is manifest by neuropsychiatric manifestations and hemodynamic instability. Caution should be exercised after a baclofen overdose in patients receiving chronic baclofen therapy.","Adult, Baclofen/*adverse effects, Cardiovascular Diseases/*chemically induced, Drug Overdose, Humans, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects, Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced, *Substance Withdrawal Syndrome, Suicide, Attempted",-1

Of 44 patients admitted, 20 of 22 in the transdermal clonidine group and 15 of 21 in the terazosin group (one patient was lost to follow-up) met the response criteria. These criteria included the completion of 1 full week of therapy with the smallest dose that resulted in a seated diastolic blood pressure of <90 mm Hg and the subsequent entrance into an 8-week maintenance therapy phase. At the end of the 8-week maintenance phase the mean seated diastolic blood pressure remained <90 mm Hg in the clonidine cohort but not in the terazosin cohort, yet the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significantly better response to clonidine when all patients who received treatment were considered. No adverse first-dose effects were experienced with terazosin. One patient who received transdermal clonidine developed contact dermatitis and withdrew from the study prematurely. The most common side effects associated with clonidine were dry mouth and fatigue while those associated with terazosin were headache and fatigue. Compliance was excellent in both groups. Seventy-nine percent of patients found transdermal clonidine preferable to the oral regimen.","Administration, Cutaneous, Administration, Oral, *Adrenergic alpha-1 Receptor Antagonists, *Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic, use, Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic, use, Adult, Aged, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Clonidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Female, Heart Rate/drug effects, Humans, Hypertension/*drug therapy, Male, Middle Aged, Prazosin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs &, derivatives/therapeutic use",-1

METHODS: 91 ASA I-II patients scheduled for elective knee arthroscopy were included. After premedication with diazepam 10 mg and naproxene 500 mg orally, they were randomly assigned into one of three groups: Group S (n=32) received spinal anaesthesia with lidocaine 50 mg/ml 1.5-2 ml in 7.5% glucose through a 27-G Quincke needle, Group E (n=29) received epidural anaesthesia with mepivacaine 20 mg/ml and epinephrine 5 microg/ml, 15-20 ml, and Group P (n=30) received propofol anaesthesia with a bolus induction of 2 mg/kg followed by infusion. RESULTS: The time from start of anaesthesia until start of operation was significantly less in Group P than in the two other Groups: 7.4+/-5.4 min as compared to 23.0+/-4.8 min in Group S and 31.0+/-9.1 min in Group E (mean+/-SD, P<0.05). After end of surgery, the duration of the postoperative regional block was 75+/-28 min in Group S and 125+/-79 min in Group E (P<0.05). In Group S and Group E the postoperative pain was significantly less than in Group P at admission to the recovery unit and 60, 120 and 180 min later (P<0.05). The overall incidence of post-operative nausea or vomiting was less than 5% with no differences between the groups. One patient in Group E had block failure and one patient in Group S had a post-spinal headache. The perioperative costs of drugs and disposables were highest in Group P (30 USD) and lowest in Group S (6.5 USD). CONCLUSION: Propofol anaesthesia results in the shortest stay in the operation theatre but a higher degree of postoperative pain and a higher cost of drugs and disposables.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Ambulatory Surgical Procedures, *Anesthesia, Epidural/adverse effects/economics, *Anesthesia, Spinal/adverse effects/economics, Anesthetics, Intravenous/*pharmacology, Arthroscopy, Female, Humans, Knee Joint/*surgery, Male, Middle Aged, Pain, Postoperative/prevention & control, Propofol/*pharmacology",-1

A carisoprodol overdose is rarely considered fatal. Nevertheless, we encountered carisoprodol in several cases, prompting review of our experience. METHODS: We did a retrospective study of cases examined at the Jefferson County Coroner/Medical Examiner Office from January 1, 1986, to October 31, 1997, reviewing investigative reports and autopsy findings. RESULTS: Carisoprodol was present in 24 cases. Seventeen decedents died of acute drug intoxication. Carisoprodol was never the sole drug detected at autopsy, nor was it ever the sole cause of death. Propoxyphene was a co-intoxicant in 8 of the 24 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Carisoprodol causes respiratory depression. Since the mechanism of death was respiratory depression in 82% of the decedents who died of acute intoxication, we consider that carisoprodol was probably responsible, in part, for those deaths. The simultaneous use of propoxyphene and carisoprodol seems to be especially dangerous.","Acute Disease, Adult, Alabama/epidemiology, Carisoprodol/administration & dosage/*poisoning, Cause of Death, Coroners and Medical Examiners, Dextropropoxyphene/administration & dosage/poisoning, Drug Overdose, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*poisoning, Poisoning/mortality, Retrospective Studies",1

The treatment period was 6 weeks preceded by a 2-week prerandomization period. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 6-mg Sirdalud, 12-mg Sirdalud MR, or placebo. The study medication was taken once per day, orally in the evening. Efficacy was measured by visual analog scale, the number of headache-free days, the daily duration of headache, and the use of paracetamol. The primary end point was the severity of daily headache derived from visual analog scale scores covering the last 2 treatment weeks. One hundred sixty patients (56 in the 6-mg group, 49 in the 12-mg group, and 55 in the placebo group) completed the study. The severity of the headache decreased similarly in the treatment groups and the placebo group. The visual analog scale values decreased from the prerandomization values by 53% in the 6-mg group, 48% in the 12-mg group, and 52% in the placebo group. The modified-release formulation of tizanidine in doses up to 12 mg taken in the evening is not superior to placebo in the treatment of chronic tension-type headache. The placebo effect was unexpectedly strong in the present study, supporting the view that psychophysiological mechanisms are of considerable importance in sustaining chronic tension-type headache.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Delayed-Action Preparations, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain Measurement, Tension-Type Headache/*drug therapy/physiopathology",1

The patients ranged in age from 43 to 55 years. Two to five episodes of respiratory failure occurred in each over a period of 4 months to 2 years. One patient developed evidence of chronic lung disease; while the others remained well between episodes. Lung biopsies showed the acute stage of DAD in 3, overlapping acute and organizing stages in 3, and the organizing stage in 2. A definite cause was not identifiable in any. However, 4 had been treated with narcotics for chronic pain before the first episode, and 1 received this treatment before the recurrent episode. Three also were receiving psychotropic drugs for anxiety and depression. Five patients had evidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and/or hiatal hernia, 2 of whom underwent Nissen fundoplication in hopes of preventing future recurrences. Although a definite cause of the recurrent DAD was not identified, the findings suggest the possibility of a reaction to narcotics and/or psychotropic drugs in some patients, with a possible additional effect of GERD.

9188029,Medical and pharmacologic management of upper extremity neuropathic pain syndromes.,Mackin GA,J Hand Ther. 1997 Apr-Jun;10(2):96-109.,"Written from a neurologic and therapeutically conservative perspective, this review advocates fundamentally medical and pharmacologic management of upper extremity neuropathic pain syndromes, including chronic regional pain syndromes, formerly classified reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) and causalgia. Mandatory steps include, first, a prompt serious attempt to localize the nerve lesion whenever possible using complete, sophisticated neurologic examinations, then thoughtfully selected conventional neurophysiologic and radiologic tests. Strongly discouraged are promiscuous use of ""RSD"" to describe all neuropathic pains, and diagnostic reliance upon thermography and uncontrolled sympathetic blocks. Conservative multidisciplinary diagnostic and treatment teams should often possess a nucleus of neurologist and hand therapist, plus additional consultants including psychiatric. Every physician and therapist managing neuropathic pain must consider psychologic and wellness issues within their responsibilities. Prompt referral to an experienced surgeon is crucial for decompression or repair of relevant, significant, objectively proven (ideally neurophysiologically) nerve and root lesions. Ambiguous professional colloquialisms, ""central pain"" and ""central sensitization,"" unfortunately provide value-laden pretexts for premature invasive treatments, and animate the truly dreadful concept ""central RSD"". Various classes of conventional oral non-narcotic adjuvant analgesics are reviewed, and the inevitability of their empiric, non-formulaic administration. No patient-specific, rationally-identifiable molecular receptor/switch can be deduced clinically or tripped mechanistically to terminate chronic pain. Two promising new non-narcotic centrally-active medications, gabapentin and tramadol, are highlighted as harbingers of future progress. The neglected subtle art of prescription writing is stressed, particularly for medication-sensitive patients. Medical cost containment should promote critical, long overdue outcomes studies comparing conservative and invasive pain treatments.","Analgesics/therapeutic use, Arm/*innervation, Chronic Disease, Drug Prescriptions/standards, Humans, Neuralgia/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology, Outcome Assessment (Health Care), Pain Measurement, Patient Care Team",-1
11942863,Sympathetic nervous activation following subarachnoid hemorrhage: Influence of intravenous clonidine.,"Lambert G, Naredi S, Eden E, Rydenhag B, Friberg P",Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. 2002 Feb;46(2):160-5.,"BACKGROUND: Subarachnoid hemorrhage is often accompanied by systemic complications and cerebral vasospasm. Elevated levels of circulating catecholamines may be involved in the pathophysiology behind these events. The alpha-2-agonist clonidine inhibits sympathetic outflow by a central mechanism. Unrestricted sympathoexcitation may be detrimental and administration of clonidine may be beneficial in these patients. METHODS: Using isotope dilution methodology, norepinephrine kinetic determinations, comprising determination of arterial norepinephrine concentration and rates of norepinephrine spillover to and removal, or clearance, from plasma, were performed on three occasions during the first week after subarachnoid hemorrhage in 25 patients. Eleven of these patients received clonidine (continuous i.v. infusion 5.8 +/- 0.7 microg x kg(-1) x 24 h(-1)) and the remainder, standard therapy. Initial results were compared with 17 healthy age-matched subjects and eight patients suffering from severe traumatic brain injury without traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. RESULTS: Subarachnoid hemorrhage patients exhibited markedly elevated arterial plasma norepinephrine concentrations [3.74 +/- 0.48, P < 0.001 vs. healthy subjects (1.59 +/- 0.11 nmol/L) and P < 0.05 vs. head trauma patients (1.94 +/- 0.29 nmol/L)]. The rate of clearance of norepinephrine from plasma in the subarachnoid patients was also significantly greater than that observed in the healthy subjects (2.66 +/- 0.15 vs. 2.14 +/- 0.15 L/min, P < 0.05) and the head trauma patients (2.00 +/- 0.12 L/min, P < 0.05). Compared with both control groups, on admission the rate of spillover of norepinephrine to plasma following subarachnoid hemorrhage was markedly elevated (9.11 +/- 1.12, P < 0.001). Clonidine treatment (continuous i.v. infusion 5.8 +/- 0.7 microg x kg(-1) x 24 h(-1)) did not reduce the increased rate of spillover of norepinephrine to plasma following subarachnoid hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: Sympathetic nervous activity is markedly elevated following subarachnoid bleeding. Clonidine had no effect on the rate of norepinephrine spillover to, or clearance from, plasma in these patients. Clearly, further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for generating sympathetic nervous activation following subarachnoid hemorrhage.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*pharmacology, Adult, Clonidine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology, Female, Hemodynamics/drug effects, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous, Male, Middle Aged, Norepinephrine/blood, Subarachnoid Hemorrhage/*physiopathology, Sympathetic Nervous System/*physiopathology",-1

Ten days of once-daily doses of either clonazepam 1 mg and placebo (CZ + PL) or clonazepam 1 mg and sertraline 100 mg (CZ + SR) were administered; there was an 11-day washout period. Sertraline did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam (p > 0.13). Clonazepam apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution, and half-life were 3.9 +/- 0.2 L/hr, 233 +/-11 L, and 40.5 +/- 0.3 hours, respectively. The kinetics of the inactive metabolite 7-aminoclonazepam were marginally affected by sertraline, with a 21% decrease in the elimination half-life (p = 0.03) relative to CZ + PL and no significant difference between treatments in area under the curve or metabolite ratio. Card sorting (CS), digit-symbol substitution test (DSST), nurse-rated sedation scale (NRSS), and self-rated sedation scores were assessed four times daily on days -1 (PL + PL), 1, 4, 7, and 10. There were no differences between treatments in area under the effect curve or maximum observed effect for CS, DSST, or NRSS. Maximum impairment on all assessment days was low, with a less than 10% change from the drug-free values for CS and DSST. Despite higher clonazepam concentrations, predose (time 0) psychomotor and sedation scores did not differ among days -1, 1, 4, 7, and 10 or between treatments.

10193597,Classification of tremor and update on treatment.,"Charles PD, Esper GJ, Davis TL, Maciunas RJ, Robertson D",Am Fam Physician. 1999 Mar 15;59(6):1565-72.,"Tremor is a symptom of many disorders, including Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, orthostatic tremor, cerebellar disease, peripheral neuropathy and alcohol withdrawal. Tremors may be classified as postural, rest or action tremors. Symptomatic treatment is tailored to the tremor type. Combination therapy with carbidopa and levodopa remains the first-line approach for parkinsonian tremor. Essential tremor may be amenable to propranolol or primidone. Propranolol may be useful in treating alcohol withdrawal tremor, and isoniazid may control the cerebellar tremor associated with multiple sclerosis. Clonazepam may relieve orthostatic tremor. Other agents are also available for the treatment of tremor. When medical therapy fails to control the tremor, surgical options such as thalamotomy, pallidotomy and thalamic stimulation should be considered in severe cases. Thalamic stimulation, the most recent of these surgical approaches, offers the advantage over ablative procedures of alleviating tremor without the creation of a permanent lesion.","Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Tremor/classification/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology/surgery/*therapy",-1

None of the new drugs appears to be a quantum leap in therapy over the others that are already available. How these new drugs will be integrated into a rational scheme for the treatment of individuals with epilepsy remains to be determined.

Three groups were created: normal screen, positive alcohol screen, or positive abused drugs screen (with or without the presence of alcohol). The admitting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was significantly lower in the positive alcohol screen group than the normal screen group, while the three groups did not differ in length of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) or years of education. Neuropsychological assessment was conducted during inpatient rehabilitation, following resolution of PTA. Normal screen patients obtained significantly better scores than the abused-drugs patients on the Full Scale IQ (FIQ) and Verbal IQ (VIQ) indices of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised and the Verbal Memory, General Memory, Attention-Concentration, and Delayed Recall indices of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Normal screen patients also scored significantly higher than positive alcohol screen patients on FIQ and VIQ indices and all five indices from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. These data suggest the existence of an additive effect of substance abuse on neuropsychological outcome in TBI.

9107526,Management of sickle pain.,Ballas SK,Curr Opin Hematol. 1997 Mar;4(2):104-11.,"Sickle cell disease is characterized by recurrent episodes of acute pain. Some patients also suffer from chronic pain syndromes including avascular necrosis, leg ulcers, and intractable pain. Approaches to rational therapy of sickle pain include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and preventive therapeutic interventions. Pharmacologic treatment of sickle pain entails the use of nonopioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and adjuvants singly or in combination depending on the severity of pain. Meticulous evaluation and assessment of painful episodes should precede and accompany all approaches to management. The choice of the opioid analgesic, its route of administration, dose, and frequency of administration should be individualized on a case-by-case basis. Meperidine should be avoided whenever possible. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, meperidine, and morphine are contraindicated in the presence of renal failure. Administration of opioids on a fixed schedule or by patient-controlled analgesia is ideal for effective therapy. Nonpharmacologic approaches to manage sickle pain are underutilized and more studies are needed to determine their role in sickle pain. Preventive therapy of sickle pain is best achieved with hydroxyurea, which was found to decrease the frequency of crises significantly, decrease the incidence of acute chest syndrome, and decrease the need for blood transfusion.","Anemia, Sickle Cell/*physiopathology/therapy, Humans, Pain/physiopathology, *Pain Management",-1

10334661,The role of excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative disease: implications for therapy.,Doble A,Pharmacol Ther. 1999 Mar;81(3):163-221.,"Glutamic acid is the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. Glutamic acid binds to a variety of excitatory amino acid receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels. It is activation of these receptors that leads to depolarisation and neuronal excitation. In normal synaptic functioning, activation of excitatory amino acid receptors is transitory. However, if, for any reason, receptor activation becomes excessive or prolonged, the target neurones become damaged and eventually die. This process of neuronal death is called excitotoxicity and appears to involve sustained elevations of intracellular calcium levels. Impairment of neuronal energy metabolism may sensitise neurones to excitotoxic cell death. The principle of excitotoxicity has been well-established experimentally, both in in vitro systems and in vivo, following administration of excitatory amino acids into the nervous system. A role for excitotoxicity in the aetiology or progression of several human neurodegenerative diseases has been proposed, which has stimulated much research recently. This has led to the hope that compounds that interfere with glutamatergic neurotransmission may be of clinical benefit in treating such diseases. However, except in the case of a few very rare conditions, direct evidence for a pathogenic role for excitotoxicity in neurological disease is missing. Much attention has been directed at obtaining evidence for a role for excitotoxicity in the neurological sequelae of stroke, and there now seems to be little doubt that such a process is indeed a determining factor in the extent of the lesions observed. Several clinical trials have evaluated the potential of antiglutamate drugs to improve outcome following acute ischaemic stroke, but to date, the results of these have been disappointing. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neurolathyrism, and human immunodeficiency virus dementia complex, several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that excitotoxicity may contribute to the pathogenic process. An antiglutamate drug, riluzole, recently has been shown to provide some therapeutic benefit in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are examples of neurodegenerative diseases where mitochondrial dysfunction may sensitise specific populations of neurones to excitotoxicity from synaptic glutamic acid. The first clinical trials aimed at providing neuroprotection with antiglutamate drugs are currently in progress for these two diseases.","AIDS Dementia Complex/etiology, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/etiology, Calcium/*metabolism, Excitatory Amino Acids/*physiology, Glutamic Acid/metabolism/*toxicity, Humans, N-Methylaspartate/physiology, Neurodegenerative Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Neurotransmitter Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors",-1

We report a patient with a trigeminal nerve section who continued to have attacks. A 59-year-old man described a 14-year history of left-sided episodes of excruciating pain centred on the retro-orbital and orbital regions. These episodes lasted 1-4 h, recurring 2-3 times daily. The attacks were associated with ipsilateral ptosis, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, rhinorrhoea and facial flushing. From 1986 to 1988, he had trials of medications without any benefit. In February 1988, he had complete surgical section of the left trigeminal sensory root that shortened the attacks in length for 1 month without change in their frequency or character. In April 1988, he had further surgical exploration and the root was found to be completely excised; post-operatively, there was no change in the symptoms. From 1988 to 1999, he had a number of medications, including verapamil and indomethacin, all of which were ineffective. Prednisolone 30 mg orally daily rendered the patient completely pain free. Sumatriptan 100 mg orally and 6 mg subcutaneously aborted the attack after approximately 45 and 15 min, respectively. He was completely anaesthetic over the entire left trigeminal distribution. Left corneal reflex was absent. Motor function of the left trigeminal nerve was preserved. Neurological and physical examination was otherwise normal. MRI scan showed a marked reduction in the calibre of the left trigeminal nerve from the nerve root exit zone in the pons to Meckel's cave. An ECG-gated three-dimensional multislab MRI inflow angiogram was performed. No dilatation was observed in the left internal carotid artery during the cluster attack. Blink reflexes were elicited with a standard electrode and stimulus. Stimulation of the left supraorbital nerve produced neither ipsilateral nor contralateral blink reflex response. Stimulation of the right supraorbital nerve produced an ipsilateral response with a mean R2 onset latency of 36 ms and a contralateral response with a mean R2 onset latency of 32 ms. Lack of ipsilateral vessel dilatation makes the role of vascular factors in the initiation of cluster attacks questionable. With complete section of the left trigeminal sensory root the brain would perceive neither vasodilatation nor a peripheral neural inflammatory process; however, the patient continued to have an excellent response to sumatriptan. The case illustrates that cluster headache may be generated primarily from within the brain, and that triptans may have anti-headache effects through an entirely central mechanism.","Blinking, Cluster Headache/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology/*surgery, Denervation/statistics & numerical data, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Angiography, Male, Middle Aged, Trigeminal Nerve/pathology/*surgery",-1
12708941,Phenytoin-diazepam interaction.,"Murphy A, Wilbur K",Ann Pharmacother. 2003 May;37(5):659-63.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of phenytoin toxicity potentially associated with concurrent diazepam therapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 44-year-old First Nations man presented to the emergency department with headache, nystagmus, diplopia, and ataxia. Apart from a long-standing seizure disorder, his past medical history was unremarkable. The antiepileptic drug regimen of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and lamotrigine had been unchanged for almost 5 months. Total phenytoin serum concentration reported 2 weeks prior to hospital admission was 8 micro g/L. Two days prior to admission, he was prescribed amoxicillin and diazepam; he denied use of nonprescription or herbal medications. The serum phenytoin concentration drawn in the hospital was 37 micro g/mL. Both phenytoin and diazepam were stopped, and the symptoms resolved. His neurologic abnormalities were attributed to phenytoin toxicity caused by an interaction with diazepam. DISCUSSION: The literature documenting a potential interaction between diazepam and phenytoin is conflicting. Case reports and controlled studies have demonstrated both increases and decreases in serum phenytoin concentrations when these agents were administered concomitantly. Phenytoin induces the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP2C, CYP2D, and CYP3A; however, phenytoin is eliminated predominantly by CYP2C9- and CYP2C19-dependent hepatic metabolism. Diazepam is one example of a drug that is extensively metabolized by CYP2C19 and could potentially influence phenytoin elimination by acting as an alternate substrate for this isoenzyme. In our patient, the timing of drug administration, clinical and physical examination findings, and laboratory data suggest that diazepam therapy resulted in phenytoin toxicity. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the adverse clinical effects observed and phenytoin and diazepam coadministration in this patient. CONCLUSIONS: Phenytoin is a known inducer of drugs metabolized by CYP2C, CYP2D, and CYP3A, but its own metabolism may be altered by drugs influencing CYP2C9 or CYP2C19, such as diazepam. Agents not acting as enzyme inhibitors or inducers, but instead behaving as alternate substrates for enzyme-binding sites, may produce clinically relevant drug interactions through an underrecognized mechanism.","Adult, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use, Diazepam/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Drug Interactions, Epilepsy/drug therapy, Humans, Male, Phenytoin/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use",-1

11996634,The pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.,"Nash LT, Hack S",Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2002 May;3(5):555-71.,"As the recognition of paediatric and adolescent anxiety disorders improves, so does the number of recommended treatments. Newer medications (chiefly serotonergic antidepressants) have emerged as the pharmacological treatment of choice and have largely replaced benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) for these disorders. This review will focus on placebo-controlled and open-label studies concerning the treatment of anxiety in children and adolescents, comparing data from newer antidepressant medications (plus buspirone) with data on TCAs and benzodiazepines in this population. There are few randomised, placebo-controlled trials of medications for anxiety in children and adolescents, with most data coming from open-label trials and case series. Moreover, there are no studies comparing pharmacological versus behavioural treatments. Most recent data concerning the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors suggests that these agents will be effective and safe in the treatment of paediatric anxiety disorders. The potential side effect profiles of these newer agents also makes them an attractive first choice for anxiety when compared to the benzodiazepines or TCAs, each of which poses its own potentially serious adverse effects. More research is needed in the area of psychopharmacological treatments for paediatric and adolescent anxiety, not only to substantiate the current beliefs that serotonergic agents are effective and safe but to pinpoint the factors that might predict responses to particular agents or classes of medications. Future investigations should focus on treatments which have already proven effective for adult anxiety disorders (both medications and psychotherapies), given the apparent links between paediatric and adult anxiety disorders.","Adolescent, Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use, *Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Child, Child, Preschool, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Administration Schedule, Fluoxetine/therapeutic use, Humans, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use",-1

Patients detoxified using a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-revised (CIWA-Ar) based PRN protocol on the addiction unit received significantly fewer chlordiazepoxide milligram equivalents over shorter duration than patients managed by other detoxification methods on other hospital units. Significantly fewer patients received benzodiazepines in the CIWA-Ar protocol managed group, but inter-group differences (p < 0.01) remained when only medicated patients were compared. Differences between the protocol and non-protocol groups did not reach statistical significance when PRN only strategies were examined, suggesting that the use of a symptom-triggered strategy may account for the noted effects.","Adult, Aged, Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium/*diagnosis, Alcoholism/*rehabilitation, Chlordiazepoxide/administration & dosage, Female, *Hospitalization, Hospitals, Veterans, Humans, Length of Stay, Male, Middle Aged, *Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), Oxazepam/administration & dosage, Washington",-1
12867216,Gabapentin dosing in the treatment of epilepsy.,"McLean MJ, Gidal BE",Clin Ther. 2003 May;25(5):1382-406.,"BACKGROUND: Gabapentin is considered a safe and well-tolerated antipileptic drug (AED) with a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and a broad therapeutic index. However, recent studies have used higher doses and faster titration schedules than those used in the pivotal trials that established the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures. OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this review were to assess the gabapentin titration and dosing regimens that have been published in peer-reviewed journals, to develop dosing recommendations to maximize antiseizure efficacy without compromising tolerability, and to formulate guidelines for an adequate therapeutic assessment of gabapentin dosage efficacy. METHODS: In the absence of sufficient placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, a formal evidence-based assessment could not be performed. However, a MEDLINE search using the search terms gabapentin and epilepsy, spanning back to the year 1986, produced numerous published reports from randomized, placebo-controlled and open-label trials, as well as case reports. These were reviewed to assess the range of dosing and titration schedules reported. Reports that employed gabapentin doses and titration schedules were selected for review. RESULTS: Our review of this literature suggests improved seizure control at higher gabapentin maintenance dosages (< or =3600 mg/d) than are used today in clinical practice (1800 mg/d) without an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions. Most of the patients who received high dosages (eg, 3600 mg/d) or experienced fast titration rates tolerated gabapentin well. Side effects occurred around the onset of dosing and were reported in some studies to be transient. CONCLUSIONS: Based in the literature here, in most adult patients, gabapentin may be initiated at a dosage of 900 mg/d and titrated to maintenance dosages > or = 3600 mg/d. Children may be treated with gabapentin 23 to 78 mg/kg per day. Based on controlled and open trials, the majority of patients will tolerate gabapentin well enough for an adequate therapeutic assessment. Titration to effect can be accomplished rapidly, if necessary; however, as with other AEDs, optimal seizure control may take months to achieve.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Administration Schedule, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Humans, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Hydroxyzine, an antagonist of histamine receptors, showed both efficacy and safety in previous short-term double-blind studies over placebo in this pathology. The aim of the current study was to confirm those positive results over a 3-month period in adult outpatients. METHOD: This multicenter, parallel (hydroxyzine [50 mg/day]; bromazepam [6 mg/day]), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 2 weeks of single-blind run-in placebo, 12 weeks of double-blind randomized treatment, and 4 weeks of single-blind run-out placebo. Three hundred thirty-four of 369 selected outpatients with a diagnosis of GAD according to DSM-IV criteria and a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score >/= 20 were randomized before entering the double-blind period. The primary outcome criterion was the change in the HAM-A score from baseline to 12 weeks of double-blind treatment with hydroxyzine compared with placebo. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat analysis, the mean +/- SD change in HAM-A scores from baseline to endpoint was -12.16 +/- 7.74 for hydroxyzine and -9.64 +/- 7.74 for placebo (p =.019). Results at endpoint for percentage of responders (p =.003) and remission rates (p =.028), Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scale score (p =.001), maintenance of efficacy (p =.022), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale score on day 84 (p =.008) also confirmed the efficacy of hydroxyzine over placebo. The study showed no statistically significant difference between hydroxyzine and bromazepam. Except for drowsiness, which was more frequent with bromazepam, safety results were comparable in the 3 groups. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyzine showed both efficacy and safety in the treatment of GAD and appears to be an effective alternative treatment to benzodiazepine prescription.","Adult, Ambulatory Care, Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology, Double-Blind Method, Family Practice, Female, Follow-Up Studies, France, Histamine H1 Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Humans, Hydroxyzine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Patient Care Team, Personality Inventory, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome",-1

Subjects consisted of 20 inpatients suffering from post-stroke in a rehabilitation hospital. The subjects were treated with various antidepressants, mainly imipramine, amitriptyline, and amoxapine. After 4 weeks of treatment, 13 showed some improvement; significant improvement in 5, moderate improvement in 5, mild improvement in 3 by a clinical global impression. Whereas all the patients aged less than 65 yr were responders, only 3 of the 10 patients over 65 yr were responders. All of the male patients, but only half of the female patients, were responders. With regards to the presence of a spouse, 13 of the 16 patients with a spouse, but none of 4 patients without, showed a response. No significant correlation was found between the occurrence of each depressive symptom and outcome. Thus, the responders were younger and had better social support in comparison with the non-responders. This result implies that antidepressants are effective for post-stroke depression.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Amoxapine/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use, Cerebrovascular Disorders/*complications, Depression/*drug therapy/*etiology, Female, Humans, Imipramine/therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies",-1

As many as 45% of patients with diabetes mellitus develop peripheral neuropathies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of gabapentin monotherapy on pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week trial conducted between July 1996 and March 1997. SETTING: Outpatient clinics at 20 sites. PATIENTS: The 165 patients enrolled had a 1- to 5-year history of pain attributed to diabetic neuropathy and a minimum 40-mm pain score on the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire visual analogue scale. INTERVENTION: Gabapentin (titrated from 900 to 3600 mg/d or maximum tolerated dosage) or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy measure was daily pain severity as measured on an 11-point Likert scale (0, no pain; 10, worst possible pain). Secondary measures included sleep interference scores, the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire scores, Patient Global Impression of Change and Clinical Global Impression of Change, the Short Form-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire scores, and the Profile of Mood States results. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients received gabapentin and 70 (83%) completed the study; 81 received placebo and 65 (80%) completed the study. By intent-to-treat analysis, gabapentin-treated patients' mean daily pain score at the study end point (baseline, 6.4; end point, 3.9; n = 82) was significantly lower (P<.001) compared with the placebo-treated patients' end-point score (baseline, 6.5; end point, 5.1; n = 80). All secondary outcome measures of pain were significantly better in the gabapentin group than in the placebo group. Additional statistically significant differences favoring gabapentin treatment were observed in measures of quality of life (Short Form-36 Quality of Life Questionnaire and Profile of Mood States). Adverse events experienced significantly more frequently in the gabapentin group were dizziness (20 [24%] in the gabapentin group vs 4 [4.9%] in the control group; P<.001) and somnolence (19 [23%] in the gabapentin group vs 5 [6%] in the control group; P = .003). Confusion was also more frequent in the gabapentin group (7 [8%] vs 1 [1.2%]; P = .06). CONCLUSION: Gabapentin monotherapy appears to be efficacious for the treatment of pain and sleep interference associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and exhibits positive effects on mood and quality of life.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Diabetic Neuropathies/*complications/drug therapy, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology, Pain Measurement, Quality of Life, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

The differential diagnosis includes many diseases that often present with weakness as well as pain. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia may now be made using the positive features of the patient's illness and classified according to well-defined criteria. The process is facilitated by the demonstration of FTPs that are quite specific for the condition. The elicitation of tenderness over these points is highly reliable and valid owing to high intrarater and interrater agreements observed in multiple studies. An algorithmic approach to differential diagnosis is presented.

10204754,Nefopam strongly depresses the nociceptive flexion (R(III)) reflex in humans.,"Guirimand F, Dupont X, Bouhassira D, Brasseur L, Chauvin M",Pain. 1999 Mar;80(1-2):399-404.,"Nefopam hydrochloride has been commercialized as an analgesic drug in most Western European countries for 20 years. It has been shown to possess analgesic activity with a profile distinct from that of opioids or anti-inflammatory drugs. In order to define the mechanisms of action of this pharmacological agent, we studied, in a double-blind and cross-over fashion, its effects on the nociceptive flexion (R(III)) reflex and the corresponding pain sensation in ten healthy volunteers. The R(III), reflex elicited by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve was recorded from the biceps femoris. Two experiments were performed on each volunteer at an interval of 7 days. On each experimental day, four recruitment (intensity-response) curves of the R(III) reflex were constructed: before (control period) and then 30, 60 and 90 min after the intravenous injection of nefopam (20 mg) or a placebo. Nefopam induced a powerful depression of the nociceptive R(III) reflex. It increased the threshold of the reflex and decreased the slope of the recruitment curve. At the same time, it decreased the painful sensations (as measured with a visual analogue scale(VAS)) elicited by the maximum stimulus intensity. These data suggest that nefopam probably produces its analgesic action through central (spinal and/or supraspinal) mechanisms. However, complementary peripheral mechanisms cannot be excluded on the basis of the present study. In view of these results, it seems that new clinical studies will have to be undertaken to revisit this potent analgesic agent and try to limit its adverse effects (i.e. nausea, vomiting, sweating). Its fast onset of action could clearly be an advantage, notably in the treatment of post-operative pain.","Adult, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*pharmacology, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Electric Stimulation, Electromyography, Electrophysiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle, Skeletal/*drug effects/physiopathology, Nefopam/*pharmacology, Nociceptors/*drug effects, Pain/physiopathology, Pain Threshold/*drug effects, Recruitment, Neurophysiological, Reflex/*drug effects",-1

11888234,Anticonvulsants: aspects of their mechanisms of action.,Soderpalm B,Eur J Pain. 2002;6 Suppl A:3-9.,"An ideal anticonvulsant drug would prevent or inhibit excessive pathological neuronal discharge without interfering with physiological neuronal activity and without producing untoward effects. Such an ideal compound is not yet available. However, during the last few years several new anticonvulsants have appeared (e.g. vigabatrine, gabapentin, topiramate, lamotrigine, tiagabine, felbamate and oxcarbazepine) which may challenge the older, more established substances (i.e. phenytoin, benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, valproate, carbamazepine and ethosuximide). Interestingly, several of the old and new anticonvulsants are beneficial in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions (most notably mood disorders) as well as neuropathic pain. The reason these various drugs are effective in the treatment of such disparate clinical conditions is unknown. The answer may be that the neuronal dysfunctions underlying these conditions are similar in a mechanistic sense, but are manifested in different neurons/locations of the nervous system, or that the drugs possess several mechanisms of action that contribute in different ways to the favourable effect depending on the condition studied. Even though all these drugs inhibit excessive neuronal activity, this acute effect appears to be produced by several mechanisms, which fall into three major categories: (1) blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels; (2) indirect or direct enhancement of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABAergic] neurotransmission; or (3) inhibition of excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission. Moreover, several of these drugs fall into more than one category, and it is often unclear which category is responsible for a given effect of a drug. It is plausible that some of the beneficial effects observed in the clinic can be explained by the secondary neural depressant mechanisms of action of these substances, whereas other benefits may be due to long-term neuroplastic effects, which may either be common or different across the various conditions treated.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Central Nervous System/*drug effects/physiopathology, Chronic Disease, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Glutamic Acid/metabolism, Humans, Neural Inhibition/*drug effects/physiology, Sodium Channels/drug effects/metabolism, Synaptic Transmission/*drug effects/physiology, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/metabolism",-1
12665421,Pregabalin: a new anxiolytic.,"Lauria-Horner BA, Pohl RB",Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2003 Apr;12(4):663-72.,"Pregabalin (S-[+]-3-isobutylgaba) was designed as a lipophilic GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) analogue substituted at the 3'-position in order to facilitate diffusion across the blood-brain barrier. It was originally developed as an anticonvulsant agent, however it has been shown to be effective in the treatment of several disorders including hyperalgesia and behavioural disorders. Although its exact mode of action remains unclear, pregabalin interacts with the same binding site and has a similar pharmacological profile as its predecessor, gabapentin (1-[aminomethyl] cyclohexane acetic acid). Its main site of action appears to be on the alpha(2)delta subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels, widely distributed throughout the peripheral and central nervous system. Pregabalin appears to produce an inhibitory modulation of neuronal excitability. In healthy volunteers, it is rapidly absorbed with peak blood concentrations within 1 h and it has a bioavailability of approximately 90%. In preclinical trials of anticonvulsant activity, pregabalin is three to ten times more potent than gabapentin. It is well-tolerated and associated with dose-dependent adverse effects (ataxia, dizziness, headache and somnolence) that are mild-to-moderate and usually transient. There are no known pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions reported to date. Preliminary animal and human studies showed beneficial effects in both ethological and conflict models of anxiety, as well as having some sleep-modulating properties. In Phase II and III trials, pregabalin shows promising anxiolytic action when compared to placebo in generalised anxiety disorder, social phobia and panic disorder.","Animals, Anti-Anxiety Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data, Humans, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*analogs &, derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use",-1
9754515,Quinine for nocturnal leg cramps: a meta-analysis including unpublished data.,"Man-Son-Hing M, Wells G, Lau A",J Gen Intern Med. 1998 Sep;13(9):600-6.,"OBJECTIVE: With respect to the use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps, to determine whether the findings of a previously performed meta-analysis of published data are altered with the addition of unpublished data, and whether publication bias is present in this area. DESIGN: A meta-analysis of eight (four published and four unpublished) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, seven of which had a crossover design. SETTING: Randomized trials that were available as of July 1997. SUBJECTS: Ambulatory patients (659) who suffered from regular nocturnal leg cramps. MAIN RESULTS: When individual patient data from all crossover studies were pooled, persons had 3.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.15, 5.05) fewer cramps in a 4-week period when taking quinine compared with placebo. This compared with an estimate of 8.83 fewer cramps (95% CI 4.16, 13.49) from pooling published studies alone. The corresponding relative risk reductions were 21% (95% CI 12%, 30%) and 43% (95% CI 21%, 65%), respectively. Compared with placebo, the use of quinine was associated with an increased incidence of side effects, particularly tinnitus. Publication bias is present in the reporting of the efficacy of quinine for this indication, as almost all published studies reported larger estimates of its efficacy than did unpublished studies. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that quinine is efficacious in the prevention of nocturnal leg cramps. However, its benefit may not be as large as reported from the pooling of published studies alone. Given the side effect profile of quinine, nonpharmacologic therapy (e.g., regular passive stretching of the affected muscle) is the best first-line treatment. For persons who find this ineffective and whose quality of life is significantly affected, a trial of quinine is warranted. Prescribing physicians must closely monitor the risks and benefits in individual patients. Publication bias is present in this area even though there is controversy about the role of quinine in the treatment of leg cramps. To minimize the possibility of this bias, persons performing medication-related meta-analyses should seek high-quality unpublished data from drug regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical companies.","Humans, Leg, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Quinine/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Risk Assessment, Treatment Outcome",1

Subjects were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist, the European Organization for Research and the Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, and a binary criterion based on the Clinical Global Impression. The incidence of successful treatment was 80% for trazodone compared with 64% for clorazepate; the sample number was too small to establish a significant difference. Bayesian analysis revealed the probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than clorazepate reduced from 35% to 18% in this small sample. Clinical evaluations using the different scales suggest some benefit from trazodone, although this was not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar. Trazodone is devoid of the risk of abuse and dependence, and may be a valuable alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of HIV-related adjustment disorders.","Adjustment Disorders/*drug therapy, Adult, Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Clorazepate Dipotassium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, HIV Infections/*psychology, Humans, Pilot Projects, Trazodone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",-1

However, cardiac side effects limit Mitoxantrone use in SPMS and its lifetime cumulative dose should not exceed 140 mg/m2. Additionally, Mitoxantrone is contraindicated for use in SPMS patients with a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < or = 50%. The goal of this study was to monitor LVEF more frequently than ordinarily recommended since experience with Mitoxantrone use in SPMS patients is limited. An unexpected decline in LVEF in one of the SPMS patients being treated with Mitoxantrone prompted further investigation into this finding. In our clinic, 47 patients on Mitoxantrone were followed prospectively; 28 of 47 patients had received a minimum of three doses and underwent a repeat LVEF evaluation prior to their fourth dose of Mitoxantrone. Of these 28 patients, five of 28 (17.8%) had a significant decline in LVEF from baseline. It is suggested that more stringent cardiac monitoring guidelines than current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations be used to avert potential cardiac complications in SPMS patients on Mitoxantrone.","Adult, Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Female, Humans, Injections, Intravenous, Male, Middle Aged, Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/*drug therapy, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Prospective Studies, Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced/radionuclide imaging",-1

This article reviews 83 MS studies in English that have presented data on quality of life. The studies may be classified into three categories, according to the application and the main focus: 1) evaluating the development and validity of quality of life questionnaires and clinical scales (n = 27); 2) evaluating factors that might influence the quality of life or comparing the quality of life among various groups (n = 37); and 3) using quality of life questionnaires as outcome measures in medical trials and other interventions (n = 19). The studies have shown that quality of life questionnaires more broadly measure the impact of MS than do the most frequently used measures of disease activity and effects. Using quality of life measures provides additional information in evaluating the effects of treatment and in studying the development of the disease. Such information is crucial in planning interventions for MS patients. A challenge in this field is to improve the study designs, including reaching some agreement on how to measure the quality of life.","*Health Surveys, Humans, Multiple Sclerosis/*psychology, *Quality of Life, Questionnaires",-1

The intravenous form of VPA, valproate, has been used extensively by neurologists since the 1980s for patients with status epilepticus, as serum levels can be achieved rapidly and telemetry is not required during administration. Psychiatrists have less experience with intravenous valproate, and little is documented in the literature regarding its nonepileptic indications. Patients who are unable or unwilling to take drugs orally, or for whom rapid treatment is clinically indicated, may benefit from VPA. Neuroleptics and benzodiazepines often are given parenterally; however, they may be accompanied by side effects. Intravenous valproate was administered successfully to three patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Intake of protein rich in large neutral amino acids is reported to lower brain tryptophan. This study was undertaken to assess whether any reduction of such proteins by exclusion of animal protein from the diet reduced pain and morbidity in fibromyalgia patients. It was an open, randomized controlled trial. 37 subjects with fibromyalgia were enrolled in the vegetarian diet and 41 in the amitriptyline groups. The outcome was assessed with the help of frequencies of fatigue, insomnia & non-restorative sleep, pain score on a 10-point VAS and tender point count. Fatigue, insomnia and non-restorative sleep were present in 41, 26 and 32 subjects before and in 3, 0 and 0 subjects respectively at six weeks of treatment in the amitriptyline group. The pain score and tender point count were 6.2 +/- 1.9 & 16.1 +/- 2.3 before and 2.3 +/- 1.3 & 6.4 +/- 3.0 after treatment. All these differences were significant (P < 0.001). In the vegetarian diet group, fatigue, insomnia and non-restorative sleep were present in 36, 24 and 27 subjects before and in 34, 29 and 29 subjects at six weeks of treatment. The pain score and tender point count were 5.7 +/- 1.8 and 15.7 +/- 2.4 before and 5.0 +/- 1.8 & 14.7 +/- 3.6 after treatment. All these differences were insignificant except that in the pain score. The decrease in the pain score, though significant, was much smaller than that in the amitriptyline group.

Literature available on the pharmacologic treatment of depression after traumatic brain injury is scarce. This study investigated in a controlled and prospective manner the use of desipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, in a series of patients with severe traumatic brain injury. METHOD: Ten patients with severe traumatic brain injury and long-standing depression, as diagnosed by DSM-III-R criteria, were admitted to the study because of the intention to be treated with antidepressants. They were randomly assigned to blindly start on either desipramine treatment (N = 6) or placebo lead-in (N = 4). Patients starting with desipramine stayed on that drug; patients starting with placebo lead-in were blindly crossed over to desipramine after 1 month if there was no significant improvement demonstrated by DSM-III-R criteria. All rating clinicians, physicians, and patients were blind to actual treatment and any ratings data. DSM-III-R evaluations were done monthly. An affect/mood scale was done every 2 weeks. RESULTS: Of all patients evaluable using the DSM-III-R, 6 (86%) of 7 demonstrated resolution of depression and depressed mood during desipramine treatment. (Three received desipramine throughout the study; 3 others started taking placebo and crossed over to desipramine,) One patient refused evaluation on DSM-III-R throughout; 2 patients, both on desipramine, dropped out because of adverse effects (seizure, mania). In addition, there was statistically significant (p = .001) improvement over time and different rates of improvement over time in the treated and untreated groups for the affect/mood scale data. CONCLUSION: Results from this small study, utilizing a blinded, placebo lead-in design appear to (1) demonstrate the clinically significant effectiveness of desipramine in treating long-standing depression in a series of patients with severe traumatic brain injury, as rated with DSM-III-R criteria; (2) show statistically significant improvement on the affect/mood scale data, favoring the treated versus untreated (placebo lead-in) group.","Accidents, Traffic, Adult, Brain Injuries/classification/*complications/diagnosis, Cross-Over Studies, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Desipramine/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Male, Placebos, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHOD: Subjects (N = 12) with resistant OCD were allocated randomly to either right or left prefrontal rTMS daily for 2 weeks and were assessed by an independent rater at 1 and 2 weeks and 1 month later. RESULTS: Subjects had an overall significant improvement in the obsessions (p < .01), compulsions (p < .01), and total (p < .01) scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) after 2 weeks and at 1-month follow-up. This improvement was significant for obsessions (p < .05) and tended to significance for total Y-BOCS scores (p = .06) after correction for changes in depression scores on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. There was no significant difference between right- and left-sided rTMS on any of the parameters examined. Two subjects (33%) in each group showed a clinically significant improvement that persisted at I month but with relapse later in I subject. CONCLUSION: A proportion (about one quarter) of patients with resistant OCD appear to respond to rTMS to either prefrontal lobe, although in the absence of a sham treatment group in this study, we cannot rule out the possibility of this being a placebo response. This treatment warrants further investigation to better establish its efficacy and examine the best parameters for response.","Adult, Dominance, Cerebral/*physiology, *Electric Stimulation Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy, Prefrontal Cortex/*physiopathology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome",-1

In other neurological disease, some etiologic factors have been detected as in the case of Guillain-Barre syndrome in which molecular mimicry between Campylobacter jejuni endotoxin and GM1 ganglioside may cause an acute inflammatory polyneuropathy. On the other hand, attempts to identify an antigen have been made in patients with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

This paper examines the existence, prevalence, and characteristics of opiate-resistant pain among persons with AIDS receiving end of life care at Bailey-Boushay House, an AIDS-skilled nursing facility in Seattle, WA. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of consecutive discharges during 1996 to 1999 examined patients near the end of life with advanced AIDS who had used opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) for pain relief. The patients were divided into a control group (n = 97) and an opiate-resistant group (ongoing, severe pain with morphine use of greater than 100 mg/hr in an alert patient with no response to doubling doses, n = 12). The two groups were compared on the basis of current diagnosis of depression, history of injection drug abuse, peripheral neuropathy, or central nervous system involvement. RESULTS: Out of a total of 740 AIDS admissions during the study period, 226 patients were admitted for terminal care. Of these, 109 utilized a PCA for pain control for at least a day before death. Twelve (1.6% of all admissions, 5% of terminal patients, 11% of PCA users) experienced opiate-resistant pain. No associations with injection drug abuse, central nervous system involvement, depression, or peripheral neuropathy were found. CONCLUSIONS: Opiate-resistant pain is rare and can be relieved by aggressive use of adjuvants for pain treatment. There are no distinguishing characteristics that are predictive of this pain syndrome among AIDS patients near the end of life. The recognition of,prompt attention to, opiate-resistant pain remains a challenge for medical providers.",MISSING,-1

12054099,Gabapentin. Pfizer.,Wheeler G,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2002 Mar;3(3):470-7.,"Gabapentin has been approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain in six European countries, New Zealand and Australia, and numerous countries in Latin America. By January 2001, Pfizer was preparing to file an NDA in the US for this indication; by October 2001, this NDA had been filed with the FDA. The drug is a GABA analog, but is not a GABA mimetic, although some neurons that respond to gabapentin are GABAergic. Gabapentin, at relevant concentrations, binds to an auxiliary protein of voltage-gated calcium channels (a2/3) and apparently, as a result, modulates the action of calcium channels and neurotransmitter release. This may account for many of its pharmacological actions. Gabapentin is also a substrate for the large neutral amino acid transporter, and this may be the major route allowing gabapentin access to the CNS. Modulation of synaptic transmission between primary afferents and substantia gelatinosa neurons, and blockade of signal transduction, are two potential mechanisms of action, in addition to inhibition of glutamate release by voltage-sensitive calcium channels.

METHODS: GBP monotherapy at daily doses up to 4,800 mg was attempted in patients participating in the open-label phase of a double-blind, dose-controlled, GBP monotherapy trial. For those who achieved monotherapy, the types and severity of adverse events were assessed and the average seizure frequency per 28 days while maintained on the highest daily GBP dose was compared to the seizure frequency during the baseline phase of the double blind trial. Correlation analysis between GBP serum level, total daily dose, and percentage of seizure change from baseline was performed. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients participated in the open-label phase of the trial and 23 (51%) were converted successfully to GBP monotherapy. In those patients, the average daily gabapentin dose was 3,900 mg and the mean length of follow-up was 252 days. Compared to baseline, there was a mean reduction of 54%, 43%, and 14% for simple partial, complex partial and secondarily generalized seizures respectively, while maintained on high-dose GBP monotherapy. A significant linear correlation between daily GBP dosage (2,400-4,800 mg) and resultant mean serum levels was found (r = 0.51; p < 0.01). There was no significant correlation between seizure frequency and total daily GBP dose or with serum levels. High-dose GBP monotherapy was well tolerated; only one patient exited the trial because of adverse events. The most common adverse event was tiredness/sleepiness and was not dose-related.

12044130,The placebo effect in alternative medicine: can the performance of a healing ritual have clinical significance?,Kaptchuk TJ,Ann Intern Med. 2002 Jun 4;136(11):817-25.,"In alternative medicine, the main question regarding placebo has been whether a given therapy has more than a placebo effect. Just as mainstream medicine ignores the clinical significance of its own placebo effect, the placebo effect of unconventional medicine is disregarded except for polemics. This essay looks at the placebo effect of alternative medicine as a distinct entity. This is done by reviewing current knowledge about the placebo effect and how it may pertain to alternative medicine. The term placebo effect is taken to mean not only the narrow effect of a dummy intervention but also the broad array of nonspecific effects in the patient-physician relationship, including attention; compassionate care; and the modulation of expectations, anxiety, and self-awareness. Five components of the placebo effect--patient, practitioner, patient-practitioner interaction, nature of the illness, and treatment and setting--are examined. Therapeutic patterns that heighten placebo effects are especially prominent in unconventional healing, and it seems possible that the unique drama of this realm may have ""enhanced"" placebo effects in particular conditions. Ultimately, only prospective trials directly comparing the placebo effects of unconventional and mainstream medicine can provide reliable evidence to support such claims. Nonetheless, the possibility of enhanced placebo effects raises complex conundrums. Can an alternative ritual with only nonspecific psychosocial effects have more positive health outcomes than a proven, specific conventional treatment? What makes therapy legitimate, positive clinical outcomes or culturally acceptable methods of attainment?

OBJECTIVE: To present two years of experience in the use of gabapentin for the alleviation of neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury patients. SETTING: Supra-regional Spinal Cord Service, Melbourne, Australia. METHOD: Data were retrieved from the medical records of all spinal cord injury patients prescribed gabapentin for neuropathic pain. Pain was assessed prior to and during treatment at 1, 3 and 6 months with a 10 cm visual analogue scale which ranged from 0 ('no pain') to 10 ('worst pain imaginable'), or by the documentation of a verbal description of pain. RESULTS: Seventy-six per cent of patients receiving gabapentin reported a reduction in neuropathic pain. In those patients with data at all four measurement points, the mean pretreatment score was 8.86. Following treatment with gabapentin the score dropped to 5.23, 4.59 and 4.13 at 1, 3 and 6 months, respectively. Where only a verbal description of pain was documented, the trend was that the pretreatment report of 'unbearable' was replaced by 'liveable' during treatment. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that gabapentin offers an effective therapeutic alternative for the alleviation of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury.

10809909,Acute neurological stroke care in Europe: results of the European Stroke Care Inventory.,"Brainin M, Bornstein N, Boysen G, Demarin V",Eur J Neurol. 2000 Jan;7(1):5-10.,"Following the 1997 Recommendations of the EFNS Task Force on Acute Neurological Stroke Care (European Journal of Neurology, 1997: 4:435-441) a European Inventory was undertaken to assess the development of acute stroke care in the EFNS member countries and to give an estimate of the needs based on 1997 data. All 30 members of the EFNS Stroke Scientist Panel were asked to complete a questionnaire on acute stroke epidemiology as well as acute stroke care in their country. Data were based either on national surveys, hospital statistics, or estimates given on the basis of extrapolation of regional studies, or other defined sources. Specialist estimates were also taken into account where no other data source was available. Data from 22 countries were received and referred to almost one million strokes occurring per year in a population of over 500 million. Most epidemiological data confirmed an east-west gap known from previous studies. These included rates that, in eastern countries, were higher for incidence, stroke as a leading cause of death, and 30-day case-fatality, and rates that were lower for overall hospitalization or availability of CT scanning. East-west differences were not seen for the total number of acute stroke units or the number of acute stroke units set up within neurological hospital departments, nor for most other quality indicators of acute stroke care with the exception of technological standards in some countries. The higher rates for 30-day case-fatality in eastern Europe (mostly above 20%) compared with western Europe (mostly below 20%) are probably caused by a case mix with more severe ischemic strokes and a higher percentage of cerebral haemorrhages admitted for acute care in eastern Europe. This is probably due to the higher prevalence of the most common risk factors for stroke in these countries which tend to result in more severe strokes. This, therefore, underlines the need for stroke prevention programmes especially in eastern Europe. This epidemiological east-west gap is not reflected by most quality indicators for acute stroke care, e.g. total number of acute stroke units available within each country. Most eastern European countries have a well-developed neurological care system for acute stroke but still have urgent technological and socioeconomical needs. The leading role of clinical neurology in acute stroke care is visible in most but not all European countries.","Aged, Europe/epidemiology, Health Care Surveys, Humans, Incidence, Intensive Care/statistics & numerical data/utilization, Middle Aged, Mortality, Prevalence, Recurrence, Stroke/*epidemiology/mortality/radiography/*therapy, Tomography, X-Ray Computed/statistics & numerical data/utilization",-1

12967573,Risk factors for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy: a controlled prospective study based on coroners cases.,"Opeskin K, Berkovic SF",Seizure. 2003 Oct;12(7):456-64.,"We performed a controlled prospective study of pathologically verified sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) in a coronial setting, to identify risk factors. We prospectively studied coronial deaths of people with epilepsy in Vic., Australia, during a 21-month period. Fifty SUDEP and 50 subjects with epilepsy who died of other causes (controls) were collected sequentially. Clinical data was obtained shortly after death from questionnaires completed by treating doctors, discussion with family members and coronial files, including police reports of death, autopsy and toxicology reports. Factors assessed were age, sex, duration of epilepsy, type of seizure(s), seizure frequency, symptomatic epilepsy, including post-traumatic epilepsy, presence of structural brain lesion, idiopathic epilepsy, mental retardation, psychiatric illness, including dementia, recent stressful life event, particular antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and AED polytherapy, compliance with AED treatment, psychotropic drug prescription, alcohol and other substance abuse, place of death and evidence of terminal seizure. The SUDEP group was characterised by younger age and higher proportion found dead in bed and with evidence of terminal seizure compared to controls. The profile of patients at risk for SUDEP are young people with epilepsy. They are most likely to die in sleep and our data support the view that SUDEP is a seizure-related event. This, taken in conjunction with the finding that there was no increased risk associated with a particular AED in monotherapy or multiple AEDs suggests that attempts to better treat patients' epilepsy with AEDs might decrease the risk of SUDEP. Although the literature suggests that SUDEP is more frequent in patients with severe epilepsy, we did not find a correlation with seizure frequency suggesting that other clinical indices may be more important.","Adolescent, Adult, Alcoholism, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Case-Control Studies, Cause of Death, Chi-Square Distribution, Child, Child, Preschool, Colony Count, Microbial, Coroners and Medical Examiners/*statistics & numerical data, Death, Sudden/*epidemiology/etiology, Dementia, Demography, Epilepsy/classification/complications/*epidemiology/mortality, Female, Humans, Intellectual Disability, Male, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Questionnaires, *Risk Factors",-1

Other causes of hepatic injury were excluded. Symptoms resolved after discontinuation of tizanidine, and the liver enzyme levels were nearly normal 6 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. Rechallenge with 4 mg tizanidine caused a relapse. The temporal relationship between the symptoms and liver enzyme elevations, the absence of other potential causes, and the reaction to rechallenge, strongly implicate tizanidine as the cause of hepatic injury. As we are not aware of similar case histories, this seems to be the first reported case of tizanidine-induced hepatic injury.","Clonidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/diagnostic use, *Drug-Induced Liver Injury, Female, Humans, Liver/enzymology, Liver Diseases/enzymology, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects/diagnostic use, Recurrence",1

Review of the literature suggests that her toxicity was so severe because of the repetitive nature of her exposure and the fact that she was partly protein restricted when first exposed. She developed profound central nervous system toxicity, as well as skin and gastrointestinal changes, that persisted for 20 months. She was treated with high doses of Valium. It was noted that every time her Valium was diminished below a critical level, her symptoms tended to recur until she had adequately cleared the lindane from her system. We believe this is the longest term of poisoning reported following exposure to an organochloride insecticide. Her symptoms are well explained by the physiology of these compounds as described in the literature. The case is important, for it represents the longest persistence of symptoms clearly associated with poisoning by the potent gamma isomer of BHC-lindane.","Administration, Topical, Adult, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Insecticides/administration & dosage/*poisoning, Lindane/administration & dosage/*poisoning, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*diagnosis, Psychoses, Substance-Induced/*diagnosis, Recurrence, Scabies/*drug therapy",-1

Gabapentin is especially effective at relieving allodynia and hyperalgesia in animal models. It has been shown to be efficacious in numerous small clinical studies and case reports in a wide variety of pain syndromes. Gabapentin has been clearly demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of neuropathic pain in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. This evidence, combined with its favourable side-effect profile in various patient groups (including the elderly) and lack of drug interactions, makes it an attractive agent. Therefore, gabapentin should be considered an important drug in the management of neuropathic pain syndromes.","Acetates/adverse effects/*pharmacology, *Amines, Analgesics/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*pharmacology, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Female, Humans, Nervous System Diseases/*complications, Pain/*etiology/prevention & control, Pilot Projects, Pregnancy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

12667111,Chronic daily headaches in children.,Hershey AD,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2003 Apr;4(4):485-91.,"Chronic daily headache (CDH) or highly frequent headaches are being recognised as an increasing problem. In adults it is estimated that up to 4% of the population has CDH, however, this number appears to be lower in children. The actual prevalence of CDH in children, however, has not been determined. The simplest definition of CDH is > 15 headache days per month. In the international headache society (IHS) criteria, only chronic tension-type headaches and chronic cluster headaches are recognised as CDH. Criteria for CDH have been suggested for adults that mirror the IHS criteria. In children, the majority of CDH appear to be migraine related. The next revision of the IHS criteria has been proposed to include chronic migraine as one of the CDH. Evaluation of CDH needs to include a complete history and physical examination to identify any possibility of the headache representing secondary headaches. Treatment and management involves a multi-tiered approach, which includes abortive therapy when the headache becomes more severe. With the precaution of avoiding overuse of analgesic medication, prophylactic therapy is used to help reduce the characteristics of the headache as well as the frequency and mild behavioural therapy.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Child, *Headache Disorders/classification/drug therapy/epidemiology, Humans",-1

An individual is described who suffered a traumatic brain injury and was determined to have suffered a panic attack during his rehabilitation stay. The manifestations of panic attacks are described, using the case report as an example. The psychological aetiology of panic disorders is also reviewed, and treatment options using four major classes of neuropharmacologic agents: benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamide oxidase inhibitors, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are discussed. Given the increasing incidence and survival of patients with traumatic brain injuries, the complications of panic attacks and disorders will become more important; they are a serious condition that can affect an individual's lifestyle, employment, and relationships, and increase the risk of suicide. Rehabilitation specialists should be aware of the manifestations and management of panic attacks and come to appreciate that recognition of this treatable condition is important during all stages of rehabilitation.","Acute Disease, Anti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, Benzodiazepines, Brain Injury, Chronic/etiology/*psychology/rehabilitation, Craniocerebral Trauma/*psychology/rehabilitation, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Panic Disorder/*drug therapy/*etiology, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use",-1

In this category, benzodiazepines rapidly gained pride of place, replacing barbiturates and becoming the most commonly prescribed of all drugs in the Western world in the 1970s. However, problems such as dependence and withdrawal reactions became apparent in the 1980s, and it seemed that the usefulness of drugs with this mode of action was limited. Recently, focus has shifted to a new group of drugs with GABA-ergic actions mediated through various mechanisms not directly involving the GABA(A) receptor. These drugs include gabapentin, vigabatrin, tiagabine, lamotrigine, pregabalin and others. Although originally developed as anticonvulsants for epilepsy, they appear to have wider applications for use in affective disorders, especially bipolar depression, anxiety disorders and pain conditions. The current information on the properties and therapeutic potential of this new generation of GABA-ergic drugs is reviewed. It remains to be seen whether long-term use leads to tolerance, dependence and withdrawal or discontinuation reactions.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy, Epilepsy/drug therapy, GABA Agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Humans",-1

The IH and SAS are thought to be important symptoms when a lesion occurs in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata, including the paramedian and lateral reticular formations. If IH appears in conjunction with a lesion in the tegmentum of the medulla oblongata, one must be vigilant for the development of SAS.","Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Female, Hiccup/*complications/drug therapy, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Medulla Oblongata/physiopathology/radiography, Methylprednisolone/therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications/diagnosis/physiopathology, Sleep Apnea Syndromes/*complications/drug therapy",-1

The purpose of this single-center multidisciplinary review was to report on the long-term safety and efficacy of CITB in the treatment of 21 children with intractable severe spasticity of cerebral origin. Nineteen recipients had spastic quadriplegia and two had spastic diplegia. Seven recipients had level IV severity on the Gross Motor Functional Classification System and 14 had level V. Median age at implantation was 12 years (range 4 to 20). Fifteen recipients were male, 6 were female. Seventeen recipients were alive at the end of the follow-up period (31 to 78 months; mean 53, SD 4). The Ashworth scale showed a substantial decrease in spasticity in the upper and lower extremities at 6 months and at the most recent follow-up. The Gross Motor Function Measure and Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory showed no functional change. Most treatment goals were at least partly achieved. Caregivers reported a reduction in use of oral medication for spasticity, and improvements in comfort, function, and ease of care. Caregiver satisfaction was high. During 80 recipient-years of pump operation, 153 treatment-associated adverse events occurred: 27 of these were device-related. There were four deaths unrelated to CITE, including one from acute pancreatitis. Our findings might assist in establishing patient selection criteria and treatment goals, improving patient follow-up, and monitoring adverse events.","Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Cerebral Palsy/*drug therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Cross-Sectional Studies, Equipment Failure, Female, Humans, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Long-Term Care, Male, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Retrospective Studies, Spinal Cord/drug effects, Treatment Outcome",-1

7510609,Place of newer antiepileptic drugs in the treatment of epilepsy.,"Kalviainen R, Keranen T, Riekkinen PJ Sr",Drugs. 1993 Dec;46(6):1009-24.,"There are several new antiepileptic drugs undergoing extensive clinical investigation. Five new drugs--vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, felbamate and oxcarbazepine--appear to be the most widely tested and promising agents. Vigabatrin is most effective in drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Vigabatrin is also effective in infantile spasms, but seems to have negative effects on myoclonic epilepsies and absence seizures. Lamotrigine and felbamate seem to be effective in partial epilepsy and in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In addition, lamotrigine and felbamate seem to have efficacy in idiopathic generalised epilepsies. Oxcarbazepine appears to be equally as effective as carbamazepine, but less toxic. Gabapentin has few adverse effects and has efficacy in some patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Some of the new antiepileptic drugs modify excitatory or inhibitory amino acid transmission, but some of them may employ new, still unknown mechanisms of action. Depending on the mechanism of action, the therapeutic effectiveness of the antiepileptic drugs may differ in specific epileptic syndromes. Future antiepileptic drugs may thus give us the possibility to design rational polypharmacy for individual patients by combining agents with different spectra of effectiveness. Considering the goal of good tolerability in the development of the new antiepileptic drugs, polypharmacy with these agents is not expected to increase adverse effects significantly.","Anticonvulsants/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Drug Interactions, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Half-Life, Humans, Intestinal Absorption",-1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-six CTH patients (10 men and 16 women) were treated with BSR (30 mg daily) for 12 weeks. A parallel group of 32 CTH patients (12 men and 20 women) was treated with AML (50 mg daily). The major clinical parameters evaluated were the headache index (days with headache per month), the frequency of drug use for the acute management of headaches, the patients' opinion for the treatment and the Hamilton anxiety and depression rating scales. RESULTS: During the study 9 patients dropped out (4 from the BSR group and 5 from the AML group). Twelve (54.4%) patients from the BSR group responded to treatment (> 50% reduction in the headache index), compared to 17 (60.7%) from the AML group. In the BSR group, 14 (53.8%) patients reported various mild side effects (nausea most frequently), vs 21 (65.5%) of the AML group (mouth dryness more frequently). Patients treated with AML had better opinion and used less drugs for the acute treatment of headaches than the BSR treated patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that BSR may be effective in the prophylactic treatment of CTH, and that further investigation in a placebo controlled study is needed.","Adult, Amitriptyline/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Anxiety/drug therapy/psychology, Buspirone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Depression/drug therapy/psychology, Female, Headache/*drug therapy/psychology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Personality Inventory, Somatoform Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHODOLOGY: To identify and evaluate all pharmacologic interventions for MIH, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of the English-language literature from 1966 to June 1998 using MEDLINE. The following search terms were used: chronic daily headache, transformed migraine, analgesic withdrawal headache, analgesic rebound headache, drug-associated headache, medication-induced headache, detoxification, and dihydroergotamine. In addition, a review of the references from relevant literature was also conducted to collect reports not identified in the MEDLINE search. RESULTS: Numerous therapies for acute management of MIH have been evaluated, although no rigorously conducted clinical trials were identified. Therapies evaluated include abrupt withdrawal of analgesics, initiation of dihydroergotamine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, methylergonovine, dihydroergotamine, sumatriptan, amitriptyline, dexamethasone, piracetam, prothipendyl, and valproate. Epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, pathophysiology, and long-term prognosis of therapy are discussed and therapeutic guidelines are offered. CONCLUSIONS: MIH is an underrecognized and difficult condition affecting headache-prone patients. The published literature concerning treatment of patients with MIH is scant and of poor quality, making it difficult for clinicians to decide on appropriate therapy. Recognition and treatment of MIH may lead to a long-term improvement in headache relief for many patients. It appears that complete withdrawal of the medications being overused is required for favorable long-term results.","Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Ergolines/therapeutic use, Headache/chemically induced/drug therapy/epidemiology/*therapy, Humans, MEDLINE, Piracetam/therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/physiopathology, Sumatriptan/therapeutic use, Thiazines/therapeutic use, Valproic Acid/therapeutic use",-1

This and other factors have impeded development of precise and effective treatment strategies. OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a brief review of the clinical syndrome of dyspepsia and its pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. METHODS: To identify articles for inclusion in this review, a search of MEDLINE was conducted using the key word dyspepsia. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous and duplicative, the search was limited primarily to literature from the last decade and to articles concerning dyspepsia in adults. RESULTS: The symptoms of dyspepsia, which may include epigastric pain, heartburn. bloating, and early satiety, defy diagnosis in as many as 50% of patients, even after endoscopy and other appropriate studies. In the other half of patients, such causative disorders as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and gastric cancer may be diagnosed. Despite controversy regarding the selection of therapy, empiric treatment is common for apparent idiopathic dyspepsia. Histamine2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), promotility agents, and coating agents have all been used as empiric therapy for dyspeptic symptoms. With empiric treatment, subsequent management is directed by the therapeutic response. In the absence of a definitive diagnosis, treatment is usually selected on the basis of the type and severity of symptoms, a thorough history and physical examination, and factors such as age and the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Five PPIs are currently available--lansoprazole, omeprazole, rabeprazole, pantoprazole, and esomeprazole--all with established efficacy in GERD and other acid-mediated disorders. The PPIs can be expected to be useful in certain patients with dyspepsia, and may be prescribed for patients who are found to re- spond to potent antisecretory therapy. Patients' concern about their symptoms, practical considerations, and restrictions imposed by managed care organizations may all affect the choice between empiric therapy and early endoscopy in patients with dyspepsia. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the variety of therapeutic options available for the symptoms of dyspepsia, the many presentations of this condition and the uncertainty of the response to the currently available therapeutic options continue to pose a substantial clinical challenge.","Dyspepsia/*diagnosis/*therapy, Endoscopy, Humans, Proton Pumps/*therapeutic use",-1

It can be a marker of underlying maternal disease processes aggravated by pregnancy, or it can be directly related to the pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). It is associated with increased risks of fetal growth retardation and, if severe, can cause both maternal and fetal problems. The risks to both mother and neonate can be reduced by appropriate supervision and therapy. Close monitoring of maternal and fetal welfare will help to determine the optimum time for delivery. Maternal hypertension should be controlled with agents considered to be well tolerated in pregnancy. Following the index pregnancy, all patients with early and/or severe hypertension should be investigated for an underlying cause. Provided that there is clinical resolution of acute pregnancy-related hypertension, investigations are usually postponed until at least 3 months following delivery.","Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use, Blood Pressure Determination/methods, Eclampsia/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Hypertension/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*therapy, Postpartum Period, Pre-Eclampsia/drug therapy, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*therapy, Pregnancy, High-Risk, Seizures/drug therapy",-1

DESIGN: Recruited into the study were patients with complaints of fever, backache and headache or general malaise and body joint pains, could recall their previous treatment for the current complaints and could show laboratory reports indicating presence of malaria parasites. Blood was taken from those patients and examined for malaria parasites. SETTING: Kampala Diagnostic and Imaging Consultants Clinic, Kampala, Uganda from 1994 to 1997. RESULTS: Out of 268 patients, 27%, 26%, 12%, 11%, 6%, 6% and 5% strains of malaria parasites were respectively resistant to chloroquine, quinine, metakelfin, fansidar, halfan, artenam and camoquine. Double drug resistance was also observed in the patients who had taken chloroquine and quinine (21%), chloroquine and fansidar (16%) and quinine and fansidar (10%) out of 86. Some strains exhibited resistance to chloroquine, quinine and fansidar (12.6%) out of 71. R III was observed in 17 strains of malaria parasites, eight of them were for chloroquine, four for fansidar and three for quinine. Twenty-six patients had frequent recurrence of malaria lasting for over one year. CONCLUSION: One third of Plasmodium falciparum strains by 1997 had acquired resistance to chloroquine and quinine and some were gradually acquiring multi-drug resistance, leading to frequent recurrence of malaria and use of many different types of antimalarials.","*Antimalarials/therapeutic use, Chloroquine, *Drug Resistance, Multiple, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum/blood/*drug therapy/epidemiology/*parasitology, Quinine, Uganda/epidemiology, *Urban Health",-1
9733291,Analgesic rebound headache in children and adolescents.,"Vasconcellos E, Pina-Garza JE, Millan EJ, Warner JS",J Child Neurol. 1998 Sep;13(9):443-7.,"For more than a decade, the frequent use of analgesics has been recognized to lead to daily headaches in adults. To date, no studies on the occurrence of analgesic rebound headache have been done on the pediatric population. We retrospectively reviewed all charts of patients with the diagnosis of headache seen in our pediatric headache clinic between January 1996 and May 1997. Among the 98 patients seen, 46 (47%) suffered from daily or near daily headaches; 30 of them were consuming daily analgesics. Twenty-four patients (mean age 12.1 years, and mean follow-up 6.2 months) successfully discontinued their analgesics. Twenty-two patients were also placed on amitriptyline. A significant reduction in the frequency (80%), severity (47%), and number of school days missed (74%) were seen. In conclusion, this data is comparable to previous observations reported in adults, and suggests that the daily use of analgesics might result in daily or near daily headaches in the pediatric population. Discontinuing daily analgesics, with the concomitant use of amitriptyline, is an effective treatment for analgesic rebound headache in this population.","Adolescent, Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Analgesics/*adverse effects, Child, Female, Headache/chemically induced/*epidemiology, Humans, Incidence, Male, Retrospective Studies",-1
11527280,The estimated cost of managing focal spasticity: a physician practice patterns survey.,"Radensky PW, Archer JW, Dournaux SF, O'Brien CF",Neurorehabil Neural Repair. 2001;15(1):57-68.,"The purpose of this study was to estimate the overall cost of managing focal spasticity after stroke (CVA) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the cost impact of individual treatments. Sixty physicians described management strategies over six treatment visits for four focal spasticity case studies (one upper and one lower extremity case for CVA and TBI). Mean and median per-case costs were determined across physicians; median per-case costs of physicians who did or did not report use of specific treatments were compared. Mean per-case costs of managing spasticity are as follows: CVA upper, $5,131; CVA lower, $5,384; TBI upper, $14,615; and TBI lower, $13,966. Median per-case costs for strategies including botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) were less than those without BTX-A in CVA upper; median costs for strategies including oral baclofen were more than those without baclofen in CVA lower. Fewer total treatments were reported with BTX-A than without; more total treatments were reported with baclofen than without. No individual treatment had a significant impact on median treatment costs in TBI. Physician-reported spasticity management costs are substantial. Despite higher drug costs for BTX-A compared with oral therapies like baclofen, strategies for managing spasticity in CVA that include BTX-A may cost less than those without BTX-A.","Brain Injuries/complications/economics, Health Care Costs, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/*economics/etiology/*therapy, Patient Care Team, Physician's Practice Patterns/*economics, *Questionnaires, Stroke/complications/economics",-1

Prompt diagnosis and treatment can minimize pain severity and duration. CASES: The case of an 88-year-old woman with sacral shingles is described. Complications led to her demise. A 35-year-old with a 6-year history of disabling vulvar pain and many diagnostic procedures was ultimately diagnosed with postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSION: Shingles needs to be included in the differential diagnosis of vulvar rashes because it is a modifiable risk factor for chronic vulvar pain. The possibility of postherpetic neuralgia must be considered in women with unexplained vulvar dysesthesia.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Female, Herpes Zoster/*complications/*diagnosis, Humans, Pain/*etiology, Vulvar Diseases/*etiology",-1

Plasma protein binding interaction studies demonstrated no clinically significant effects on narcotic analgesics, hydroxyurea, warfarin, diazepam or digitoxin, but an increase in free fraction for propranolol. The plasma concentrations increased proportionate with increasing dose in all species tested. Renal clearance accounted for 90% of total plasma clearance in man. A single metabolite was detected and quantified in the plasma from dogs and humans that was cleared more slowly than parent drug. Allometric scaling of plasma clearance and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) across species provided good predictions of the pharmacokinetic parameters in humans.

In paralyzed subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI), it has recently been shown that the release of hGH to provocative stimulation and plasma insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels are reduced. The acute administration of baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid derivative, has been shown to stimulate hGH release. The present study investigated the effect of chronic administration of baclofen on the provocative testing of hGH secretion and plasma IGF-I levels. Sixteen subjects with SCI were studied; eight subjects were treated (40-80 mg/day; > 6 months) with baclofen (Bac+), and eight were not (Bac-). Additionally, 8 non-SCI subjects were studied as controls. The groups were matched for gender and age. The subjects were not receiving any medications known to influence hGH secretion. After an overnight fast, arginine hydrochloride (30 g/subject) was infused iv over 30 min, with blood drawn for hormone determinations at baseline and 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. In the Bac- group compared with the Bac+ group, the arginine-stimulated mean plasma hGH levels at 30 and 60 min (P < 0.05) and peak and sum plasma hGH levels (P < 0.01) were reduced. There were no significant differences in the plasma hGH response between the Bac+ group and the control group. Plasma IGF-I levels may reflect the integrated tissue response to hGH. A significant inverse relationship was present between age and plasma IGF-I levels for the control and Bac+ groups, but not for the Bac- group. The mean plasma IGF-I level was significantly reduced in the Bac- compared with the Bac+ group. No significant differences in mean plasma IGF-I levels were noted between the Bac+ and control groups. SCI is associated with body composition changes and metabolic alterations that may be exacerbated by reduced activity of the hGH-IGF-I axis. Oral chronic baclofen therapy appears to reverse the deleterious effects of paralysis and immobilization on hGH physiology.","Adult, Age Factors, Arginine/*pharmacology, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Growth Hormone/*secretion, Humans, Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis, Spinal Cord Injuries/drug therapy/*metabolism",-1

In the ED, the diagnosis can be easily overlooked and misdiagnosed as acute or chronic low back pain and muscle spasm. This syndrome is often associated with diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. This report describes an illustrative case of a 39-year-old woman who presented to the ED with a two-year history of right leg spasms and low back pain that had become so severe in the preceding two days that she was unable to ambulate. Clues to the patient's proper diagnosis coincide with the diagnostic criteria for stiff-man syndrome: the presence of a slowly progressive stiffness of the axial muscles and proximal limb muscles, making ambulation difficult; hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine; episodic spasms precipitated by jarring or sudden movement; a normal intellectual, sensory, and motor examination when not in spasm; and a marked amelioration of symptoms with the IV administration of diazepam.

12875883,The safety of pharmaceutical excipients.,"Pifferi G, Restani P",Farmaco. 2003 Aug;58(8):541-50.,"The most important part of a medicine as far as its weight is concerned, is constituted by its excipients, which have the important functions of guaranteeing the dosage, stability and bioavailability of the active principle. The components employed as excipients must present the characteristics required by their technological function but, as with any substance administered to man, they must also correspond to suitable safety requirements. In fact, in the past the importance of evaluating the possible adverse effects of excipients was underestimated, because their inertia and innocuity were taken for granted. The safety profile of these substances is more deeply researched as regards the toxicological aspect only if they are also employed in the food industry (anti-oxidants, sweeteners, colouring agents, etc.). Indeed, in this case, the International Toxicological Committees (among which the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, a mixed committee of the WHO/FAO) demand thorough studies in laboratory animals, with the intent of protecting the consumer's safety. Tackling the question of the toxicity of excipients thoroughly is not a simple matter for several reasons: the large number of substances on the market and the diversity of their chemical profiles, their sources, their technological functions, and the presence of secondary products and/or contaminants that may be the true causes of adverse effects. In this article we shall review the principal classes of excipients and their respective side effects. Then we shall proceed to their toxicological evaluation, giving examples of: (a) intrinsic toxicity, or adverse effects that may be encountered in the whole population; and (b) specific toxicity, which manifests only in people who are carriers of a transmissible disease or who are genetically predisposed, such as people with allergies and intolerances.","Animals, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Drug Interactions, Excipients/*adverse effects/chemistry/classification/*toxicity, Humans, Quality Control",-1

Current therapy primarily includes use of centrally acting muscle relaxants, which are beneficial in treating some symptoms, but frequently have extensive side effects, such as sedation and muscle weakness. Tizanidine, a central alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, has been shown in clinical studies to be as effective as other commonly used antispastic agents, but without debilitating muscle weakness. Tizanidine can cause sedation, which is minimized by dose titration. When taken at night, patients report improvement in getting to sleep and little drowsiness or ""hangover sensation"" upon waking.

We hypothesize that these changes would be manifested as progressive increases in reflex response with repetitive stimulus application (i.e., ""windup"") of the flexion reflexes. We investigated the windup of flexion reflex responses in 12 individuals with complete chronic SCI. Flexion reflexes were triggered using trains of electrical stimulation of plantar skin at variable intensities and inter-stimulus intervals. For threshold and suprathreshold stimulation, windup of both peak ankle and hip flexion torques and of integrated tibialis anterior electromyographic activity was observed consistently in all patients at inter-stimulus intervals < or =3 s. For subthreshold stimuli, facilitation of reflexes occurred only at intervals < or =1 s. Similarly, the latency of flexion reflexes decreased significantly at intervals < or =1 s. Patients that were receiving anti-spasticity medications (e.g., baclofen) had surprisingly larger windup of reflex responses than those who did not take such medications, although this difference may be related to differences of spasm frequency between the groups of subjects. The results indicate that the increase in spinal neuronal excitability following a train of electrical stimuli lasts for < or =3 s, similar to previous studies of nociceptive processing. Such long-lasting increases in flexion reflex responses suggest that cellular mechanisms such as plateau potentials in spinal motoneurons, interneurons, or both, may partially mediate spinal cord hyperexcitability in the absence of descending modulatory input.","Adult, Aged, Baclofen/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Electric Stimulation, Electromyography, Female, Humans, Interneurons/physiology, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Neurons/physiology, Movement/*physiology, Muscle Contraction/*physiology, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/innervation/physiology, Reaction Time/physiology, Reflex, Abnormal/*physiology, Spinal Cord/cytology/physiopathology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*physiopathology",-1

Yet, to our knowledge, the use of gabapentin for neuropathic pain in the presence of cognitive impairment has not been reported. In this report, we describe two patients (one with a traumatic brain injury, one with a putative acquired brain injury) who presented to a neurorehabilitation unit complaining of pain that was diagnosed as neurologically mediated. Within one week of receiving a daily 900 mg dose of gabapentin, both patients complained of heightened anxiety and restlessness. Correspondingly, each reported a diminution of psychological symptoms within 48 hours of gabapentin cessation. These two cases suggest that gabapentin may cause agitation in cognitive impaired patients.

Therefore, effective sedation throughout the procedure is an important aspect of patient management. The balanced sedation technique uses combinations of sedatives to meet the anxiolytic and analgesic needs of the individual patient. For example, benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics, while propofol can be used to provide a suitable level of sedation, especially in patients who have expressed a wish to remain asleep during the procedure. Analgesics should be considered only in those patients who are likely to experience pain during the procedure. Basic measures to increase the comfort of the patient and to facilitate the effect of pharmacological methods include supplementary non-pharmacological techniques, for example the use of a soft mattress to prevent back pain, infusion of warmed fluids and a warm operating atmosphere. This may extend to the opportunity for patients to listen to music if they have a fear of the sounds associated with the operating room, such as technical discussions by surgical staff or the sound of surgical instruments being used and discarded. The balanced sedation technique can, therefore, help to achieve the ideal goal of a comfortable patient who is free from anxiety and pain, and can sleep if desired.","Anesthesia, Conduction/*methods, Clonidine, Conscious Sedation/*methods, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives, Ketamine, Midazolam, Propofol",-1

Six hemiparetic patients (average age, 50 (range, 42-66) yr) with more than 6 mo of disabling lower limb spastic hypertonia on one side caused by either a unilateral traumatic brain injury or a stroke were recruited in a consecutive manner. The setting was a tertiary care outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation center directly attached to a university hospital. Patients were screened via a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design to receive either an intrathecally administered bolus injection of normal saline or 50 microg of baclofen. Data for Ashworth rigidity scores, spasm scores, and deep tendon reflex scores were collected on the affected upper limb and lower limb side. Those who dropped an average of two points on their affected lower limb side Ashworth scores were then offered computer-controlled pump implantation for continuous intrathecal administration of baclofen. Differences over time were assessed via descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon's signed-rank test. After 3 mo of treatment, the average lower limb Ashworth score on the affected side decreased from 3.7 +/- 1.0 to 1.9 +/- 0.6 standard deviation (SD) (P < 0.0001), the reflex score from 1.8 +/- 1.3 to 0.5 +/- 0.8 SD (P = 0.0208), and the spasm score from 1.3 +/- 1.2 to 0.8 +/- 1.3 SD (P > 0.05). The average upper limb Ashworth score on the affected side decreased from 3.4 +/- 0.9 to 2.1 +/- 0.9 SD (P = 0.0002), the reflex score from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 1.7 +/- 0.5 SD (P > 0.050, and the spasm score from 0.8 +/- 1.3 to 0 +/- 0 SD (P > 0.05). The average intrathecally administered dose of baclofen that was required to attain these effects was 205.3 microg, which was continuously infused for 24 h.

After a period of remarkable improvement in both the spasticity level and his quality of life, the patient experienced several short-lasting episodes of increased spasticity, with severe spasms. Among the possible causes of these deleterious episodes were microcrystalluria, obstipation, a decubitus ulcer, a foreign body in the buttocks, drug tolerance to baclofen, electromagnetic interference, and erroneous filling and programing of the pump. The catheter was the most common source of intrathecal baclofen withdrawal symptoms and had to be changed four times in 5 yr. Intrathecal baclofen administered through an implantable drug administration device is a highly effective but complex and expensive procedure that requires careful patient selection and close monitoring by highly qualified and well-trained health professional. Withdrawal symptoms may be related to noncompliance on the part of the patient, erroneous filling or programing of the pump, depletion of the battery, random component failure, concomitant illness, drug tolerance, or advancement of the disease itself. When failure of the device is suspected, substitution with oral baclofen is recommended until a full work-up is performed to determine the defect.","Adult, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Diagnosis, Differential, Equipment Failure, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable/*adverse effects, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology, Paraplegia/*complications, Recurrence, Severity of Illness Index, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/diagnosis/*etiology/prevention & control",-1
8956071,Postoperative pain management in the neurosurgical patient.,"Cousins MJ, Umedaly HS",Int Anesthesiol Clin. 1996 Fall;34(4):179-93.,"We hope to have inspired an interest in approaching the pain management issues in this challenging group of patients. Despite significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of pain, the development of therapeutic options, and the publication and dissemination of guidelines, this progress does not seem to have been adopted into clinical practice. Bonica has stated ""for many years I have studied the reasons for inadequate management of postoperative pain, and they remain the same.... Inadequate or improper application of available information and therapies is certainly the most important reason"". Let us accept the challenge to re-evaluate pain management in the postoperative neurosurgical patient. Future development may provide enhanced multimodal analgesia with the development of enantioselective NSAIDs and peripherally acting opioids that do not cross the blood-brain barrier. Targeted inhibition of the central neuroplasticity that underlies sensitization, rather than attempts to use pre-emptive analgesics, may be more fruitful. Inhibition of excitatory amino acids may prove beneficial for perioperative neuroprotection and pain management. In addition, longer-acting local anesthetics show significant promise. The importance of understanding the specific benefits available and matching these characteristics to the particular patient is emphasized. Evaluation of outcomes, including morbidity and patient satisfaction, will determine if effective and rational provision of analgesia may indeed be safer than withholding analgesia. However, it is clear that re-evaluation and refinement of conventional therapy is necessary.","Analgesia, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Humans, *Neurosurgery, Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Piperidines/administration & dosage",-1

This emerging entity has been registered in eight families so far. We report on five patients from three unrelated Italian families affected by pseudo-TORCH syndrome. Reevaluation of literature allowed us to draw a specific clinical profile of the syndrome. Indeed, congenital microcephaly, congenital cerebral calcification, spasticity and seizures are the main clinical features, and have been present in almost all patients reported so far. On the contrary, findings resembling congenital infectious diseases including neonatal icterus, hyperbilirubinemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatomegaly, affect less than half of the patients. Considering the diagnosis of pseudo-TORCH syndrome in patients with neonatal microcephaly and cerebral calcification is necessary since an early diagnosis may allow adequate genetic counseling to the families.","Brain/*abnormalities/*pathology/radiography, Calcinosis/etiology/pathology/radiography, Child, Child, Preschool, Diagnosis, Differential, Female, Humans, Infant, Italy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nervous System Malformations/*pathology/physiopathology/radiography, Tomography, X-Ray Computed",-1

11893276,Hypertensive disease in twin pregnancies: a review.,"Krotz S, Fajardo J, Ghandi S, Patel A, Keith LG",Twin Res. 2002 Feb;5(1):8-14.,"Reports over the past seventy years show that twin gestations lead to an increased risk of hypertensive disorders. Numerous studies discuss the incidence of hypertensive disease in twin versus singleton gestations, as well as effects of parity, race, age, income level, smoking, zygosity and heritability on this condition. The range of relative risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia for twin compared to singleton gestations is 1.2 to 2.7, 2.8 to 4.4 and 3.4 to 5.1 respectively. Parity, African-American ethnicity, and young maternal age are all factors that increase the relative risk of acquiring hypertensive disease to 4.0, 1.8 and 1.5 in mothers of twin gestations. Factors such as maternal smoking, income level and zygosity have a negligible effect on the relative risk of acquiring hypertensive disease in twin gestations. In addition to twin mothers exhibiting a higher incidence of hypertensive disease compared to their singleton counterparts, they also exhibit an earlier onset of hypertensive disease at both 35 and 37 weeks of gestation comparatively. Uric acid levels measured at 30-31 weeks of gestation in twin mothers predicted the onset of preeclampsia with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 74%. The range of risks presented in the literature is wide and the therapies avocated are diverse. We therefore decided to summarize the risks in a comparative fashion and to review current therapeutic strategies for the convenience of clinicians who confront increasing numbers of multiple pregnancies. The tables bring all recent published risks together in the first comparative analysis in which the data has been converted to relative risks and confidence intervals. Because the literature is relatively silent on specific management of hypertensive disease in twin pregnancies, general management recommendations for singleton gestations should be used by practitioners caring over twin gestations.","Eclampsia/epidemiology/etiology/therapy, Female, Humans, Hypertension/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy, Incidence, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/*epidemiology/therapy, *Pregnancy, Multiple, Risk Factors, Twins, Uric Acid/blood",-1

Despite best efforts on the part of clinicians, approximately 25% of children remain refractory to appropriate medical therapies. The development of an improved classification system and the emergence of several new antiepileptic drugs have enabled some progress in this area, specifically in children with disorders such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and infantile spasms, which are notoriously difficult to control. However, limited data are available that define the optimal use of new antiepileptic agents in pediatric patients. To most effectively treat children with epilepsy syndromes, further research must be completed to validate the positive effects described in case reports, open-label clinical trials, and early controlled clinical trials.","Acetates/therapeutic use, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Child, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Epilepsy/classification/*drug therapy, Fructose/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Humans, Nipecotic Acids/therapeutic use, Phenylcarbamates, Propylene Glycols/therapeutic use, Triazines/therapeutic use, Vigabatrin/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Follow-up period indicates that negative modulators of excitatory amino-acid function can induce a stable benefit. The persistent benefit is seemingly due to an inhibitory effect on the process underlying the hyperalgesia state which is a crucial feature of migraine. It can also be suggested that the antagonist activity at NMDA receptor might play a role in very severe non-opioid analgesic drug dependence.","Acetates/pharmacology, Adult, *Amines, Chronic Disease, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Ketamine/therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/complications/*drug therapy/metabolism, Opioid-Related Disorders/drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/prevention & control, Triazines/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
9088760,Cerebral palsy.,"Dabney KW, Lipton GE, Miller F",Curr Opin Pediatr. 1997 Feb;9(1):81-8.,"Cerebral palsy is caused by a static lesion to the cerebral motor cortex that is acquired before, at, or within 5 years of birth. Multiple causes for the condition exist and include cerebral anoxia, cerebral hemorrhage, infection, and genetic syndromes. Cerebral palsy is commonly classified according to the type of movement problem that is present (spastic or athetoid) or according to the body parts involved (hemiplegia, diplegia, or quadriplegia). To care for children with cerebral palsy, a team approach is most effective; the team should include the pediatrician and orthopedist, among others. In the nonambulatory patient, good sitting posture, the prevention of hip dislocation (spastic hip disease), and the maintenance of proper custodial care are prime concerns. Careful monitoring and treatment of spastic hip disease and the correction of scoliotic spinal deformity are also important. In the ambulatory patient, the main goal is to maximize function. Computerized gait analysis in patients with complex gait patterns helps to show whether orthotic or surgical treatment is indicated. In this paper, we also review both the proper indications for orthopedic intervention in patients with upper extremity involvement and recent methods to control spasticity, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy and administration of botulinum toxin or intrathecal baclofen.","*Cerebral Palsy/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy, Child, Preschool, Gait, Humans, Incidence, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Orthopedics, Patient Care Team, Pediatrics",-1

Patients with spasticity complain of stiffness, involuntary spasm and pain. The majority of patients are managed conservatively with physiotherapy and/or oral medication. However, 25-35% of patients will develop unacceptable side-effects or fail to respond to oral doses of antispasmodics. Surgical procedures such as myelotomy, rhizotomy and neurotomy have not been universally successful. More recently, intrathecal baclofen has become established as an important adjunct in the management of spasticity.

In an attempt to diminish unwanted side effects, lower doses were chosen than if either drug had been used alone. Anesthesia was induced with alfentanil, 75 micrograms/kg, followed by a sleep dose of propofol (mean dose 0.5 mg/kg). Maintenance in the precardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) period was achieved by infusions of propofol (6 mg/kg/h) and alfentanil (100 micrograms/kg/h). These were decreased by two thirds on commencement of CPB, and increased to half the initial rate on rewarming to 32 degrees C. Additional boluses of alfentanil were used to control breakthrough hypertension. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) fell significantly on induction. MAP but not LVSWI returned to baseline levels at skin incision. The cardiac index (CI) was maintained. A degree of myocardial depression was suggested by a fall in LVSWI despite maintaining preload, and by the failure of CI to increase in the presence of a reduced SVR. Anesthesia was satisfactory in all but one patient who developed breakthrough hypertension on sternotomy with transient ST segment depression, and awareness after CPB despite a plasma alfentanil concentration of 450 ng/mL. Mean time to wakening was 55 minutes. The study indicated that TIVA using propofol and alfentanil in the dosages described provides satisfactory basal anesthesia for coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with good left ventricular function, but requires additional pharmacologic manipulation, particularly with boluses of alfentanil, to control breakthrough hypertension.","Adult, Aged, Alfentanil/*administration & dosage, Anesthesia Recovery Period, *Anesthesia, Intravenous, Awareness, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Cardiopulmonary Bypass, *Coronary Artery Bypass, Electrocardiography/drug effects, Humans, Hypertension/etiology/prevention & control, Male, Middle Aged, Myocardial Ischemia/etiology, Propofol/*administration & dosage/blood, Stroke Volume/drug effects, Surgical Procedures, Elective, Time Factors, Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects",-1

Complications, which are rare and usually presented as case reports, are diversified as the utilization of the procedure is expanded. The procedure causes less blood loss and less morbidity when compared to open surgical procedures. Yet, there are some reports involving severe bleeding and relevant morbidity during surgery. These are usually related with the surgical technique or experience of the surgeon. Renal sheaths are designed to cause minimal trauma inside the kidney and, to our knowledge, there are no reports presenting the rupture of a sheath causing severe bleeding during the procedure. CASE REPORT: We present an adult patient who had severe bleeding during percutaneous nephrolithotomy due to parenchymal injury caused by a ruptured renal sheath. During retrieval, due probably to rough handling of the equipment, a piece of stone with serrated edges ruptured the tip of the sheath, and this tip caused damage inside the kidney. The operation was terminated and measures were taken to control bleeding. The patient was transfused with a total of 1600 ml of blood, and the stones were cleared in a second look operation. CONCLUSION: Although considered to be a minimally invasive procedure, some unexpected complications may arise during percutaneous nephrolithotomy. After being fragmanted, stone pieces may damage surgical equipment, causing acute and severe harm to the kidney. Surgeons must manipulate the equipment with fine and careful movements in order to prevent this situation.","Hemorrhage/*etiology, Humans, Kidney/injuries, Kidney Calculi/*complications/*surgery, Kidney Diseases/*etiology, Male, Middle Aged, Nephrostomy, Percutaneous/*adverse effects, Rupture, Stents, Wounds, Penetrating/etiology",-1

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of IRAEs during the first week of systemic amphotericin B therapy and to identify pretreatment regimens that are effective in preventing these IRAEs. Three hundred ninety-seven adult inpatients receiving amphotericin B therapy were prospectively monitored, and data regarding IRAEs and pretreatment regimens were collected. Of these patients, 282 (71%) developed at least one IRAE during the first 7 days of therapy. The IRAEs most commonly reported were fever (51% of patients) and chills (28%), followed by nausea (18%), headache (9%), and thrombophlebitis (5%). The most common regimens included diphenhydramine, a corticosteroid, acetaminophen, and heparin, administered alone or in combination with these or other drugs. Overall, common pretreatment regimens were similar in efficacy to no pretreatment in the prevention of IRAEs. Thus empirical premedication for IRAEs associated with amphotericin B cannot be routinely advocated; instead, patients should be treated when symptoms first arise and then premedicated for subsequent amphotericin B infusions.","Acetaminophen/therapeutic use, Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use, Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Diphenhydramine/therapeutic use, Fever/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control, Headache/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control, Heparin/therapeutic use, Humans, Incidence, Infusions, Intravenous, Nausea/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control, *Premedication, Prospective Studies, Shivering, Thrombophlebitis/chemically induced/epidemiology/prevention & control",-1

7482673,Delayed onset of fatal basilar thrombotic embolus after whiplash injury.,"Viktrup L, Knudsen GM, Hansen SH",Stroke. 1995 Nov;26(11):2194-6.,"BACKGROUND: Whiplash injuries are generally seen after rear-end rather than frontal car collisions. Previous reports have documented death up to 8 days after serious whiplash injury. We report a case of lethal basilar thrombotic embolus that occurred 2 months after the patient's injury in a collision. CASE DESCRIPTION: After whiplash trauma in a car accident, a 50-year-old taxi driver suffered from headache and episodic visual disturbances. Two months after the accident he suddenly lost consciousness and was admitted to the hospital. A CT scan performed at that time was indicative of basilar thrombosis. The patient died 3 days later. The autopsy revealed a thrombosis in the right vertebral artery and a thrombotic embolus in the basilar artery. Microscopically, a lesion of the right vertebral artery was found at the level of the atlantoaxial joint. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the whiplash injury caused a lesion of the right vertebral artery, leading to repeated transient ischemic attacks and finally to a fatal basilar thrombotic embolus. We suggest that in patients with disturbances of the vertebrobasilar circulation, attention should be paid to occurrence of neck trauma in the preceding 3 months. Further, anticoagulant therapy should particularly be considered in patients who after suffering neck injuries develop signs of transient ischemic attacks with origin from the posterior cerebral circulation.","Basilar Artery/*pathology, Cerebral Infarction/*etiology, Fatal Outcome, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Thromboembolism/*etiology, Whiplash Injuries/*complications",-1

Baclofen, a GABA agonist, is frequently prescribed for spasticity but its effects on walking have not been well quantified. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of clonidine, cyproheptadine and baclofen on walking in SCI subjects with incomplete injuries. A motorized treadmill was used and harness support provided when necessary. A repeated single-subject design was employed for the twelve subjects. The greatest effects were found in more severely disabled subjects. Cyproheptadine was associated with greatly reduced need for assistance, increases in maximum treadmill speed (MTS) and reduced clonus. Clonidine was associated with increases in MTS and a generally more upright posture. Baclofen was associated with minor changes in walking. In many cases of drug effects, MTS increases and other changes were retained following washout of drugs. The significance and implications of the drug effects and the retention of effects during washout periods are discussed. It is concluded that clonidine and cyproheptadine have different effects but both appear useful for severely disabled SCI subjects.

This study reports the frequency of chronic use of symptomatic headache medications implicated in drug-induced chronic headache among primary-care headache (PCH) patients and identifies predictors of chronic/frequent use. The design uses a 2-year cohort study of a sample of PCH patients in Group Health Cooperative of Puget Sound, a large health maintenance organization in Seattle, WA. Among 779 PCH patients (aged 18-74 years) interviewed at baseline, 662 (85%) completed both 1- and 2-year follow-up interviews. This study estimates the percent of PCH patients reporting: (1) frequent use of over-the-counter, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, opioid, sedative-hypnotic, and ergot medications (defined as 14 or more days of use for each class in the prior month), (2) chronic/frequent use of these medications, defined as surpassing criteria for frequent use on at least 2 of the 3 study interviews, and (3) chronic/frequent polypharmacy, defined as chronic/frequent use of 2 or more classes of headache medication. Twenty-one percent of PCH patients were chronic/frequent users of symptomatic headache medications, while 2.6% met study criteria for chronic/frequent polypharmacy. Chronic/frequent use of over-the-counter medications (15.9%) was twice as common as chronic/frequent use of prescription medications (7.7%). Headache days at baseline was the strongest predictor of chronic/frequent medication use. After controlling for baseline persistence and severity, older patients were more likely to be chronic/frequent users of headache medications. The age effect was explained by chronic/frequent use of over-the-counter medications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*adverse effects, Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects, Ergotamine/adverse effects, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Headache/*drug therapy, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*adverse effects, Male, Middle Aged, Multivariate Analysis, Risk Factors, Time Factors",-1

DESIGN: A cost analysis was conducted as part of a prospective, multicentre, multidisciplinary, randomised and placebo-controlled clinical trial. The study covered the period from December 1991 to September 1995. The data on medical consumption and costs were collected over a 3-year period from different sources: administrative databases of health insurance companies, hospital registries and a patient survey. These data were structured by means of a flowchart analysis of the medical decision-making by specialists and general practitioners (GPs). They included data on in- and outpatient care, home care and care in nursing homes. The cost analysis was conducted using data from 18 patients included in the trial and from 15 so-called 'match' patients. The latter group are patients with comparable diseases leading to spasticity and living in comparable circumstances. Next to absolute costs (direct and indirect) of care and treatment for the 2 groups of patients, cost differences between the 2 groups were considered (differential cost analysis). SETTING: Per patient cost data, collected prospectively for 2 years during the phase of clinical evaluation, and retrospectively 1 year before implantation. The data were collected on patients from in- and outpatient care, home care and care in nursing home settings. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: The trial patients (8 men) had a mean age of 46 years; 11 patients had multiple sclerosis and 7 patients had spinal cord injuries. The match patients (7 men) had a mean age of 48 years; 9 patients had multiple sclerosis and 6 patients had spinal cord injuries. INTERVENTIONS: Trial patients were treated with a subcutaneously implanted programmable continuous infusion pump (SynchroMed, Medtronic), filled with baclofen (a muscle relaxant) to treat patients with chronic disabling spasticity who did not respond to a maximum dose of oral baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: An analysis of hospital stay between both groups showed a significant difference during the implantation year. The average number of hospital days per patient in the year in the treated group was 31.5 days and in the match group was 18.7 days. Significant cost differences between both groups in the year that started with pump implantation and the following year can be attributed mostly to the costs of implantation of the pump and related hospitalisation days. The total costs of patient selection, testing, implanting the pump and follow-up amounted to $US28,473 for the first year. Savings must be taken into consideration as well. The savings of direct costs were due to withdrawal of oral medication (estimated annual total of between $US1950 and $US2800 per patient). Indirect savings on employment and nursing home costs, amounted annually to $US1047 and $US5814, respectively. Scenarios make it possible to consider policy consequences. The case of 'extending' the indications for this treatment to a larger population has been calculated and visualised.

10402329,Neurological manifestations of malaria : an update.,"Garg RK, Karak B, Misra S",Neurol India. 1999 Jun;47(2):85-91.,"Several neurological complications are associated with complicated and severe falciparum malaria. Cerebral malaria is one of the most dreaded complication. The children are particularly more vulnerable to have this complication. Despite availability of several potent antimalarial drugs in recent past, the mortality status has not changed. A large number of survivors are left with disabling neurological sequelae. Few patients may experience post-malaria neurological syndrome after recovery from complicated falciparum infection. Various psychiatric syndromes have been described either as early manifestation of cerebral malaria or part of post malaria neurological syndrome. From Indian subcontinent several patients of delayed cerebellar ataxia have also been described following recovery from clinical malaria. In paediatric patients, convulsions of cerebral malaria need to be differentiated from febrile convulsions. Falciparum malaria is also associated specifically with convulsions in uncomplicated patients of malaria. Several isolated case reports of various other neurological syndromes like peripheral neuropathies, various movement disorders, myelopathies and stroke like syndrome have been described. However association of these neurological manifestations with malaria remains doubtful.","Brain Diseases/*etiology, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum/*complications, Syndrome",-1
12196059,Clonidine-induced hypertension in a patient with a spinal lesion.,"Backo AL, Clause SL, Triller DM, Gibbs KA",Ann Pharmacother. 2002 Sep;36(9):1396-8.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of possible clonidine-induced hypertension (by Naranjo score) in a patient with a C4 spinal lesion. BACKGROUND: Clonidine is a medication long used to treat hypertension, and it is still used in the treatment of refractory hypertension. Although effective, clonidine use is hindered by adverse effects and its dual mechanism of action. CASE SUMMARY: A 39-year-old white, quadriplegic man with poorly controlled pain displayed many characteristics consistent with autonomic dysfunction (e.g., C4 spinal lesion, orthostatic hypotension, hypertension). The patient was routinely receiving transdermal clonidine and also received transdermal nitroglycerin paste as needed for control of acute hypertensive episodes. On the recommendation of the home healthcare pharmacists, clonidine was discontinued. Since that time, the patient's blood pressure and the use of emergent antihypertensive treatment have decreased significantly (maximum systolic and diastolic BP by approximately 50 and 25 mm Hg, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Many of the characteristics of autonomic dysfunction, such as refractory hypertension, can seem selective for the use of clonidine and, because of its reliance on central alpha(2)-activity for its hypotensive effects, clonidine may induce hypertension in patients with autonomic dysfunction. Clonidine should be used with great caution when autonomic dysfunction is suspected.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Adult, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Fructose/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Humans, Hypertension/*chemically induced, Male, Neuroprotective Agents/therapeutic use, Pain/drug therapy/etiology, Pain Measurement, Paraplegia/complications, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications",-1

However, little is known about the efficacy of quetiapine in patients with psychotic mood disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of psychotic mood disorders in comparison with nonaffective psychotic disorders and identify clinical factors associated with quetiapine response. METHOD: In a naturalistic setting, by reviewing medical records, we assessed response to quetiapine and factors associated with response to quetiapine in 145 consecutive patients newly treated with the drug at a nonprofit academic psychiatric hospital. These patients had received a discharge diagnosis of bipolar disorder (manic, mixed, or depressive type), major depression with psychotic features, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder (bipolar or depressive type), delusional disorder, or psychosis not otherwise specified (NOS) according to DSM-IV criteria. RESULTS: Patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic, mixed, or depressed and schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type displayed higher response rates (> 74%) compared with patients with schizophrenia. However, this finding did not achieve statistical significance. A diagnosis of major depression with psychotic features (p = .02) and longer duration of illness (p = .03) were associated with less chance of responding. CONCLUSION: Quetiapine may be a useful alternative or adjunctive treatment for patients with bipolar and schizoaffective disorders.","Adult, Affective Disorders, Psychotic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology, Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy/psychology, Chronic Disease, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/psychology, Dibenzothiazepines/*therapeutic use, Female, Hospital Records, Humans, Male, Prognosis, Psychotic Disorders/drug therapy/psychology, Retrospective Studies, Schizophrenia/drug therapy, Schizophrenia, Paranoid/drug therapy/psychology, Schizophrenic Psychology, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

Treatment response in veterans with combat-related PTSD has been disappointing. Although anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and antidepressants have been tried, none has been consistently associated with improvement in all primary symptom domains (i.e., intrusive recollections, avoidance/numbing, and hyperarousal). This open-label study evaluated the use of nefazodone in a group of Vietnam veterans with chronic, treatment-refractory symptoms of PTSD. METHOD: Male outpatients with DSM-IV PTSD who had failed a minimum of 3 previous medication trials were eligible for the study. Nineteen Vietnam combat veterans entered the study and were treated with nefazodone, 100-600 mg/day, for 12 weeks. PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, sleep, sexual functioning, and adverse events were assessed weekly. RESULTS: Severity of depression lessened, as did PTSD symptoms of intrusive recollections, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Depressive symptom severity as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory decreased by a mean of 30%. Similarly, there was an overall drop in the intensity of PTSD symptoms as measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale of 32% with a 26% improvement for symptoms of intrusion, 33% for avoidance, and 28% for arousal. In addition, improvements in sleep and sexual functioning were reported. The mean daily dose of nefazodone after 12 weeks was 430 mg (range, 200-600 mg/day). The most frequently reported side effects were headaches (53%), dry mouth (42%), and diarrhea (42%), but side effects tended to be mild and transient. CONCLUSION: In this group of Vietnam veterans with chronic treatment-refractory PTSD and multiple comorbid Axis I psychiatric disorders, nefazodone was well tolerated and effective.

Lamotrigine (10-100 mg/kg, s.c.), felbamate (150-600 mg/kg, i.p.) and gabapentin (30-300 mg/kg, i.p.) each reversed cold allodynia (chronic constriction injury model) with ED50 values of 28, 241 and 103 mg/kg, respectively, 1 h post-dose. However, only gabapentin reversed tactile allodynia (spinal nerve ligation model) with an ED50 of 34 mg/kg (i.p.). The established anti-epileptic drugs, carbamazepine (1-30 mg/kg, i.p.) and phenytoin (1-100 mg/kg, s.c.), were ineffective in both models. The anti-allodynic effect of the newer anti-epileptic drugs was observed at doses that were either ineffective or produced only a negligible effect on acute nociceptive function and/or locomotor activity. In conclusion, the data suggest that the newer anti-epileptic drugs appear to have the potential to be effective alternatives to either carbamazepine or phenytoin in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

12864753,Analysis of the patients attending a specialist UK headache clinic over a 3-year period.,Dowson AJ,Headache. 2003 Jan;43(1):14-8.,"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed the profile of patients who attended a specialist UK headache clinic over a 3-year period. METHODS: An audit was conducted of the clinical records of patients attending the specialist headache clinic at King's College, London, between January 1997 and January 2000. Data were collected for diagnoses given, current medications taken, medications prescribed and recommended, and investigations conducted. Results were calculated as numbers and proportions of patients for the 3-year period and for the 3 separate 12-month periods. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients were included in the audit. Most patients were diagnosed as having chronic daily headache (CDH, 60%) or migraine (33%). Prior to the clinic visit, most patients with CDH and migraine treated their headaches with analgesics, and there was little use of prophylactic medication. In the clinic, 74% of patients with CDH and 85% of migraineurs were prescribed prophylactic medication, and 81% of migraineurs were given triptans for acute treatment. Diagnostic testing was performed in 12% of the patients, and all results were normal or negative. CONCLUSIONS: CDH and migraine were the most common headache types encountered in this UK secondary-care clinic. Review of treatment patterns used prior to the initial clinic evaluation suggests that management of CDH and migraine in UK primary care is suboptimal, and educational initiatives are needed to improve headache management.","Analgesics/therapeutic use, Great Britain, Headache/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Headache Disorders/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Humans, London, Migraine Disorders/drug therapy/prevention & control, Pain Clinics/*utilization, Primary Health Care/statistics & numerical data, Referral and Consultation, Retrospective Studies, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/therapeutic use, Time Factors",-1

In order to answer this question, human acute pain studies, individual placebo-controlled studies for the treatment of specific chronic pain syndromes, and metaanalytic studies were reviewed and placed into table format. Analysis of this evidence led to the following conclusions: The evidence was consistent in indicating that overall antidepressants may have an antinociceptive effect in chronic pain, and that these drugs were effective for neuropathic pain. There was also some evidence that these drugs could be effective for psychogenic or somatoform disorder-associated pain. This evidence also strongly suggested that serotonergic-noradrenergic antidepressants may have a more consistent antinociceptive effect than the serotonergic antidepressants. Finally, this evidence indicated that antidepressants could be effective for pain associated with some specific pain syndromes, such as chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, fibrositis or fibromyalgia, and ulcer healing. Possible reasons for the conflicting results of studies in this area are presented, and problems that could limit the validity of the conclusions of this review are discussed.","Animals, Antidepressive Agents/blood/*therapeutic use, Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy/physiopathology, Chronic Disease, Clinical Trials as Topic, Colonic Diseases, Functional/drug therapy/physiopathology, *Evidence-Based Medicine, Facial Pain/drug therapy, Fibromyalgia/drug therapy, Headache/drug therapy, Humans, Low Back Pain/drug therapy, Meta-Analysis as Topic, Neoplasms/physiopathology, Osteoarthritis/drug therapy/physiopathology, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Rats",-1

There was a significant post-treatment change in the factor measuring 'somatic anxiety' and in individual ratings of 'shaking', 'palpitations', 'dizziness', 'restlessness', 'muscular tension', 'physical tiredness' and 'irritability', which was mainly due to significantly higher ratings of somatic anxiety in the 100 mg group compared with the other two groups. Further changes in mood were revealed after the stress of cognitive testing, with the 100 mg group showing greater increases in the 'psychological anxiety' and the 'aggressive mood' factors (as measured from the Bond and Lader scales).","Adult, Affect/*drug effects, Arousal/drug effects, Benzhydryl Compounds/*pharmacology, Central Nervous System Stimulants/*pharmacology, Cognition/*drug effects, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects, Task Performance and Analysis",-1

Several serotonergic agents have been studied for use in FMS. Trials and case reports focusing on the use of newer agents: the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and tramadol, were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Current research suggests that the serotonergic agents may reduce at least some of the symptoms of FMS.

12696998,Preventative treatment for migraine and tension-type headaches : do drugs having effects on muscle spasm and tone have a role?,Freitag FG,CNS Drugs. 2003;17(6):373-81.,"Baclofen, tizanidine and botulinum toxin A, agents used to treat disorders of muscle tone, have been studied as potential preventative treatments for migraine, tension-type headache and other related disorders. The most extensive work has been completed with botulinum toxin A. However, there is still a paucity of well controlled, clinical trials with this agent, and overall there have been conflicting and oftentimes equivocal results: studies of its use in migraine headache have suggested efficacy, whereas those of tension-type headache have not shown significant evidence of efficacy. There were few significant adverse events associated with the use of botulinum toxin A in these trials. The mechanism by which botulinum toxin A may work to prevent headache is not clear. Although changes in muscle tone may play a role in the effect of the drug, central mechanisms such as effects on neuropeptides involved in the pathogenesis of migraine may also be relevant. Further clinical trial work is in progress to help determine optimal administration schedules and choice of injection locations with botulinum toxin A for specific headache disorders. There has been limited study of the use of baclofen, an agent that acts centrally via GABA(A) receptors, in migraine and cluster headache, with only two open trials conducted to date. Both of these studies support the use of baclofen in the preventive treatment of headache.Tizanidine, which may have both a peripheral and a central mechanism in the locus ceruleus in migraine headache, has been studied in several clinical trials. Although the primary mechanism of action of this agent is, like clonidine, as an alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, it has little antihypertensive effect. Open trials of tizanidine have shown it to be useful in chronic headache. One well controlled trial, conducted as a follow-up to an open-label trial in the preventive treatment of chronic daily headache, reported tizanidine as having a statistically significant benefit over placebo. Also of interest is its use in conjunction with a long-acting NSAID to aid in the treatment of rebound headache accompanying the discontinuation of overused acute migraine therapies. In conclusion, though limited, the studies suggest the efficacy of botulinum toxin A, baclofen and tizanidine in primary headache disorders.","Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Botulinum Toxins, Type A/*therapeutic use, Clonidine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, GABA Agonists/therapeutic use, Humans, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Neuromuscular Agents/therapeutic use, Tension-Type Headache/*drug therapy/prevention & control",-1

In adults, pencil point spinal needles are supposed to be less traumatic and hence to be superior compared with cutting point needles in respect of postpuncture complaints. In children, the use of spinal needles with a special tip design have not been compared. The aim of this study was to study the clinical utility and postpuncture characteristics of four newly designed spinal needles in paediatric surgery. METHODS: In this open-randomised, parallel groups, prospective study we compared the puncture quality, success rate and postpuncture characteristics in 200 children aged 2 to 128 months. Two cutting point needles; a 50-mm-long 25G Quincke and a 25-mm-long 26G Atraucan were compared with two pencil point needles; a 37-mm-long 27G Whitacre and a 35-mm-long 24G Sprotte. The children were premedicated with oral diazepam and those anxious or uncomfortable after premedication were sedated with i.v. thiopentone or propofol. Bupivacaine 5 mg ml-1 0.3-0.5 mg kg-1 was used for the SA. RESULTS: The spinal puncture was successful with one or two skin punctures in 96% of children. The cutting point needles were easier to insert through the skin and ligaments (P = 0.001) but the pencil point needles gave a better (P = 0.001) indication of the dural passage. The success rate of the SA was 91% without differences between the needles. Five patients were given general anaesthesia and 13 children a single dose of i.v. fentanyl/sedative. The spinal block was completed in less than 3 min in 96% of the cases without differences between the needles. Seventeen children developed a headache, 10 of which were classified as a postdural puncture headache (PDPH), 3 with the Sprotte, 3 with the Quincke and 4 with the Atraucan needles. The youngest child developing PDPH was a 12-month-old boy. Eight of the PDPH were mild and 2 moderate. Ten children developed a low back pain, 2-3 in each study group. Three children in the pencil point groups developed signs of transient radicular irritation. CONCLUSION: SA using bupivacaine and the study needles produced smooth and safe anaesthesia for paediatric surgery with a high success rate. PDPH after SA is as common in children (5%) as in adults although most often mild and short lasting. SA using bupivacaine can cause transient radicular irritation.","Anesthesia, Spinal/*adverse effects, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Headache/*etiology, Humans, Infant, Irritants/toxicity, Male, Needles, Prospective Studies, Spinal Nerve Roots/*drug effects, Spinal Puncture/*adverse effects",-1

These difficulties are thought to be an important cause of relapse to alcohol use. However, the treatment of sleep problems with hypnotic drug is made difficult by cross-tolerance between benzodiazepines and alcohol. In this report, we evaluated the capacity of trazodone (TRZ), a second-generation antidepressant with anxiolytic and sedative properties, to increase the sleep efficiency in alcohol-dependent patients after detoxification. Sixteen patients completed the TRZ (n = 8) or the placebo (PL; n = 8) treatment arms. Polysomnographies were performed at baseline, after the 1st drug dose, and after 4 weeks of treatment. The main outcome was sleep efficiency. Secondary outcomes included changes in other sleep parameters, Hamilton Depression Rating and Clinical Global Impression scales. Sleep efficiency was increased in the TRZ group when it was computed after sleep onset, both immediately after 1st administration of the drug and after 4 weeks of treatment. No benefit was observed in the PL group. Sleep improvement under TRZ also included the number of awakenings, intermittent wake sleep time, and non-rapid eye movement sleep.

Intention tremor and eye movement deficits are frequently observed in multiple sclerosis (MS). The goal of this study was to examine the characteristics of intention tremor and simultaneously produced eye movements during rapid goal-directed movements. Eye and hand movements were synchronously measured in 16 MS patients with intention tremor and 16 control subjects. Manual performances of the patient group were characterized by a delayed onset, slower execution and aiming inaccuracies. In line with the clinically defined picture of intention tremor differences between patients and control subjects were most pronounced toward the end of the movement. Dependent variables were obviously greater in MS patients compared with control subjects, and correlated well with clinical outcome measures. The application of an inertial load to the limb did not show any effect on intention tremor. In addition to impaired limb coordination, evidence has been found that eye movements, too, were abnormal in patients compared with control subjects. Moreover, eye and hand movement deficits seemed to be closely related, suggesting a common underlying command structure. Inaccurate eye movements were likely to hamper an accurate motor performance of the hand.","Adult, Biomechanical Phenomena, Eye Movements/*physiology, Female, Functional Laterality, Hand/physiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Activity/*physiology, Multiple Sclerosis/complications/*physiopathology, Psychomotor Performance/*physiology, Tremor/etiology/*physiopathology, Weight-Bearing",-1

Clinical experience and numerous studies document some sort of relationship, but the exact nature remains understudied and complex. Changes in sleep duration and sleep quality appear to be capable of affecting headaches of different types. Obstructive sleep apnea can cause or exacerbate headaches in a susceptible person. Obstructive sleep apnea also may cause a specific headache when awakening, which is different from migraine or tension headache and disappears after treatment of the sleep and breathing disturbance. Hypnic headache is another type of sleep-exclusive headache that has been proposed.

Patients who have cancer or treatment-related pain are more likely to be anxious than cancer patients without pain. Patients with cancer pain and anxiety cause difficult diagnostic dilemmas because some degree of anxiety is a normal response to having a severe medical illness. Furthermore, the somatic symptoms of anxiety often overlap with symptoms related to underlying disease processes or treatment effects. The degree of disruption in a patient's life often is the critical factor in distinguishing normal from maladaptive anxiety. Making an accurate diagnosis will help guide anxiety treatment and screening instruments can facilitate the recognition of those patients in need of further assessment. The relationship between pain and anxiety is complex and bidirectional, with interactions occurring on physiologic and psychologic levels. There are a variety of psychopharmacologic, psychotherapeutic, and complementary/alternative treatments available. A comprehensive approach to care includes these approaches in an individualized way. Terminal sedation is examined as a compassionate option for relieving intractable distress at the end of life.","Anxiety/*complications/psychology/therapy, Humans, Neoplasms/*complications/psychology/therapy, Pain/*complications/psychology, Pain Management",-1

Various classes of neuroprotective agents have reached phase III efficacy trials in focal ischemic stroke, but none has proven effective, despite successful preceding animal studies. This notwithstanding, recent favorable results of hypothermia in human cardiac arrest trials have validated the general concept of neuroprotection. In addition, the promise of neuroprotective therapy for focal acute ischemic stroke has been renewed by innovations in strategies of preclinical drug development and clinical trial design that rectify past defects, including trial testing of combination therapies rather than single agents and novel approaches to accelerating time to initiation of experimental treatment.","Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Apoptosis/drug effects, Brain Ischemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology, Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology/therapeutic use, GABA Agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Humans, Ion Channels/drug effects, Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Nitric Oxide/physiology, Receptors, Opioid/antagonists & inhibitors, Stroke/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology",-1

This cohort of MS patients with TN presents a series of management challenges including poor tolerance of antineuralgic medications and occasional bilateral presentation. We analyzed our surgical series of MS patients presenting with TN who were treated with percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy to estimate the success, failure and recurrence rate of this procedure for those patients. METHODS: Surgical reports were retrospectively reviewed between the years 1996-2000. Patients with MS and TN who received a percutaneous rhizotomy during that time were included in the study and followed until the end of 2002. Data regarding age, sex, duration of MS and pain, response to medical treatment, pain distribution and surgical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: There were thirteen patients with MS and medically refractory TN treated with percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy. The average age at diagnosis for MS was 41 with TN beginning an average of eight years later. Following rhizotomy, complete pain relief without the need for any medication was achieved in 81% of the patients. The addition of medications resulted in pain control in the remaining patients. During a mean follow-up period of 52 months, there was a 50% recurrence rate. There were no complications related to the procedure and the associated facial numbness was well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy is a safe and effective method for the treatment of TN in patients with MS. The unique susceptibility of this cohort to the side effects of antineuralgic medications may require early consideration of rhizotomy.","Adult, *Catheter Ablation, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Palliative Care, Retrospective Studies, *Rhizotomy/methods, Treatment Outcome, Trigeminal Neuralgia/*complications/*surgery",-1

METHODS: Two hundred eight patients who fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia were entered into a 6-month prospective, double-blind, multicenter trial and were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, or placebo. RESULTS: After 1 month, 21%, 12%, and 0% of the amitriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, and placebo patients, respectively, had significant clinical improvement (amitriptyline versus placebo P = 0.002, cyclobenzaprine versus placebo P = 0.02, amitriptyline versus cyclobenzaprine P not significant). These percentages increased to 36%, 33%, and 19%, respectively, at the 6-month assessment (P not significant). The nature and frequency of side effects reported by patients treated with amitriptyline and those reported by patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were similar. A normal Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profile at baseline was predictive of clinical improvement at the 1-month evaluation (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2-9.0). However, neither the MMPI profile nor any of the demographic, clinical, or functional parameters evaluated at baseline predicted long-term response. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm the short-term efficacy of amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine in a small percentage of patients with fibromyalgia. Long-term efficacy could not be demonstrated because of a higher-than-expected placebo response.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency, clinical features, and long-term outcomes of quinine-associated TTP-HUS. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Hospitals in central-western Oklahoma. PATIENTS: 225 consecutive patients with TTP-HUS, 1989-2000. MEASUREMENTS: Presenting features and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome was associated with quinine in 17 patients. Four patients died, and 7 survivors currently have chronic renal failure. Since 1 July 1995, 132 patients with clinically suspected TTP-HUS were explicitly asked about drug exposure. Fourteen (11%) had taken quinine, and 7 had taken other drugs associated with TTP-HUS. Neurologic abnormalities were as severe in patients with quinine-associated TTP-HUS as in the 118 patients who had not taken quinine. CONCLUSIONS: Quinine is a common cause of drug-associated TTP-HUS and can cause death and chronic renal failure. When the disorder is described as TTP-HUS rather than only as HUS, the severity of neurologic abnormalities and the occasional absence of renal failure are emphasized.

12197456,Lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in treatment-resistant depression.,"Barbee JG, Jamhour NJ",J Clin Psychiatry. 2002 Aug;63(8):737-41.,"BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsant lamotrigine has been reported to be efficacious and well tolerated as monotherapy in the treatment of bipolar patients as well as in treatment-refractory bipolar disorder. However, there is a paucity of research on the use of lamotrigine as an augmentation agent in treatment-refractory unipolar major depressive disorder. METHOD: This study was a retrospective chart review on the efficacy of lamotrigine augmentation in 37 individuals diagnosed with chronic or recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV) who had failed to respond adequately to at least 2 previous trials of antidepressants. Thirty-one patients who were on lamotrigine treatment for at least 6 weeks (6 discontinued prematurely due to adverse events) took a mean dose of 112.90 mg/day for a mean of 41.80 weeks. The primary efficacy parameter for this study was the Clinical Global Impressions scale, which was retrospectively applied. In addition, these data were supplemented by an analysis of prospectively rated Global Assessment of Functioning scores. RESULTS: On the basis of intent-to-treat analysis, response rates were as follows: 40.5% (15/37) much improved or very much improved, 21.6% (8/37) mildly improved, and 37.8% (14/37) unchanged. The percentage of patients who were rated much or very much improved and completed 6 weeks on the drug was 48.4% (15/31). No differences were found in the doses of lamotrigine given to responders and nonresponders. CONCLUSION: Analyses revealed that lamotrigine treatment was most effective for patients who had been depressed for shorter periods of time and had failed fewer previous trials of antidepressants. Data also suggested a trend toward increased response for patients with comorbid anxiety disorders and/or chronic pain syndromes.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy, Chronic Disease, Comorbidity, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/drug therapy/epidemiology, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Triazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",-1
10222541,Recommendations for physical activity in patients with multiple sclerosis.,"Petajan JH, White AT",Sports Med. 1999 Mar;27(3):179-91.,"For many years, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, have been advised to avoid exercise. MS is believed to be autoimmune in origin, mediated by activated T cells which penetrate the blood-brain barrier and attack myelin. The pathophysiology, with respect to function is an impairment of saltatory conduction, specifically, slowing of conduction speed and/or conduction block. Symptoms can temporarily worsen on exposure to heat or during physical exercise. Exercise programmes must be designed to activate working muscles but avoid overload that results in conduction block. Fatigue, often severe, affects about 85% of MS patients and, along with motor and sensory symptoms, results in decreased mobility and reduced quality of life. Physical activity and recreation are reduced in patients with MS. Before developing recommendations, physical activity patterns and the physical effects of MS should be assessed in individual patients. Patients may then be functionally classified. Physical activity can also be classified in a pyramid structure, with the most basic functions forming the base and the most integrated functions on top. The muscular fitness pyramid progresses through passive range of motion, active resistive, specific strengthening and integrated strength exercises Overall physical activity may be increased according to functional level by performing activities of daily living, incorporating inefficiencies into daily living, pursuing more active recreation and eventually developing a structured exercise programme. The importance of the proper exercise environment, balance and coordination issues and factors related to adherence are discussed.","Activities of Daily Living, Exercise, Exercise Therapy/*methods, Female, Humans, Male, Multiple Sclerosis/*physiopathology/*rehabilitation, Physical Fitness, Prognosis, Treatment Outcome",-1

We tested whether acute ACEI might influence the effects of isometric exercise in patients with CHF. In the first part of the study we showed that isometric exercise increased blood pressure in the control group and in the CHF group, whereas cardiac output increased only in the control group. Stroke volume remained unchanged in the control group, whereas it decreased significantly in CHF group. We next analyzed the effect of acute ACEI (5 mg ramipril) on the decrease in cardiac output during isometric stress in patients with CHF. During isometric exercise mean blood pressure and heart rate increased similarly in both groups. However, cardiac output decreased during placebo by -0.48 +/- 0.12 L/min (p < 0.01) but not during ACEI. Spectral analysis of blood pressure showed an increase (p < 0.01) in the high-frequency parasympathetic component from 7.3% +/- 3.6% to 18.1% +/- 9.5% after ACEI. norepinephrine plasma levels increased after isometric stress in the placebo group, whereas other hormones did not change. ACEI prevented the norepinephrine increase after isometric stress. Thus the decrease in cardiac output during isometric exercise in patients with CHF was prevented by acute ACEI.

Although the etiology remains unclear, characteristic alterations in the pattern of sleep and changes in neuroendocrine transmitters such as serotonin, substance P, growth hormone and cortisol suggest that dysregulation of the autonomic and neuroendocrine system appears to be the basis of the syndrome. The diagnosis is clinical and is characterized by widespread pain, tender points and, commonly, comorbid conditions such as chronic fatigue, insomnia and depression. Treatment is largely empiric, although experience and small clinical studies have proved the efficacy of low-dose antidepressant therapy and exercise. Other less well-studied measures, such as acupuncture, also appear to be helpful.

12589923,Pain and rehabilitation after spinal cord injury: the case of sensory spasticity?,Sjolund BH,Brain Res Brain Res Rev. 2002 Oct;40(1-3):250-6.,"Sixty percent of patients with posttraumatic para- or tetraplegia suffer from severe, continuous burning and/or lancinating pain. Multiple sclerosis produces pain in more than 30%. This pain can be as important as the absent mobility or sexual function as a cause of lowered quality of life. Two unique types of longstanding neuropathic pain can be recognized in persons with spinal cord injury: (1). segmentally distributed pain at the lesion; and (2). pain in the body below the lesion, often with late onset. The first type could be produced by nerve root entrapment or by direct segmental deafferentation. The second type probably contains several forms of central pain, evoked either by the original spinal lesion, by an expanding syrinx in the spinal cord or by secondary changes at higher levels of the somatosensory systems. Patients with central pain almost always have stimulus-independent pain. Its intensity may vary independently, be related to the presence of visceral activity/inflammation or be constant. In addition, stimulus-dependent pain is sometimes present, usually because skin areas or viscera below the lesion are allodynic. Partial spinal lesions, especially centrally in the cervical spinal cord, may be more prone to produce pain than are complete lesions. There is limited analgesic effectiveness in controlled studies of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, of sodium channel blockers (lidocaine, tetracaine), of the GABA receptor agonist baclofen (one study) and of the NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine (one study). There are anecdotal reports on oral carbamazepine, on gabapentin, on intrathecal opiates and also on the alpha(2)-agonist clonidine, being effective in central neuropathic pain. Neurostimulation is effective only if it evokes paraesthesia in the painful area; hence TENS may give relief of segmental pain. Neurodestructive procedures and central neurostimulation have been largely unsuccessful. As in other longstanding pain, improved coping through cognitive-behavioural rehabilitation may be helpful for the clinical outcome.","Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/*physiopathology, Neurons, Afferent/*physiology, Pain/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology/*physiopathology, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/epidemiology/*physiopathology/*rehabilitation",-1
11129121,Anticonvulsants for neuropathic pain syndromes: mechanisms of action and place in therapy.,"Tremont-Lukats IW, Megeff C, Backonja MM",Drugs. 2000 Nov;60(5):1029-52.,"Neuropathic pain, a form of chronic pain caused by injury to or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system, is a formidable therapeutic challenge to clinicians because it does not respond well to traditional pain therapies. Our knowledge about the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain has grown significantly over last 2 decades. Basic research with animal and human models of neuropathic pain has shown that a number of pathophysiological and biochemical changes take place in the nervous system as a result of an insult. This property of the nervous system to adapt morphologically and functionally to external stimuli is known as neuroplasticity and plays a crucial role in the onset and maintenance of pain symptoms. Many similarities between the pathophysiological phenomena observed in some epilepsy models and in neuropathic pain models justify the rational for use of anticonvulsant drugs in the symptomatic management of neuropathic pain disorders. Carbamazepine, the first anticonvulsant studied in clinical trials, probably alleviates pain by decreasing conductance in Na+ channels and inhibiting ectopic discharges. Results from clinical trials have been positive in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. The availability of newer anticonvulsants tested in higher quality clinical trials has marked a new era in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Gabapentin has the most clearly demonstrated analgesic effect for the treatment of neuropathic pain, specifically for treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Based on the positive results of these studies and its favourable adverse effect profile, gabapentin should be considered the first choice of therapy for neuropathic pain. Evidence for the efficacy of phenytoin as an antinociceptive agent is, at best, weak to modest. Lamotrigine has good potential to modulate and control neuropathic pain, as shown in 2 controlled clinical trials, although another randomised trial showed no effect. There is potential for phenobarbital, clonazepam, valproic acid, topiramate, pregabalin and tiagabine to have antihyperalgesic and antinociceptive activities based on result in animal models of neuropathic pain, but the efficacy of these drugs in the treatment of human neuropathic pain has not yet been fully determined in clinical trials. The role of anticonvulsant drugs in the treatment of neuropathic pain is evolving and has been clearly demonstrated with gabapentin and carbamazepine. Further advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain syndromes and well-designed clinical trials should further the opportunities to establish the role of anticonvulsants in the treatment of neuropathic pain.","Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Humans, Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Syndrome",-1
12514688,Variations among emergency departments in the treatment of benign headache.,"Vinson DR, Hurtado TR, Vandenberg JT, Banwart L",Ann Emerg Med. 2003 Jan;41(1):90-7.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The practice patterns of US emergency departments in the treatment of patients with isolated benign headache have been recently described. How treatment varies among EDs has not been reported. To assess institutional variability in the pharmacotherapy of patients with benign headache, we describe and analyze the practice patterns of 3 US EDs. METHODS: This health records survey included a cohort sample of consecutive adult patients aged 16 to 65 years treated with parenteral medication for isolated benign headache at 3 nonaffiliated US EDs: a large, group-model health maintenance organization, a tertiary-care academic center, and a rural community hospital. Patients who underwent a diagnostic search for intracranial pathology, who had any nonheadache secondary diagnosis, or who had coexistent trauma, fever (temperature of > or =38.0 degrees C [100.4 degrees F]), or known pregnancy were excluded from study analysis. Demographic, clinical, and pharmacotherapeutic variables were collected for each ED visit. Descriptive analyses were performed; comparisons were made with t tests. RESULTS: Of the 490 eligible patients treated during the 4-month study period, the mean age was 36.4 years, and 374 (76%) were women. During their 629 visits, 364 (58%) received a migraine diagnosis, and 258 (41%) received a nonspecific headache diagnosis. Polypharmacy was common: 515 (82%) received 2 or more medications, and 154 (25%) received 3 or more medications. Pharmacotherapy varied greatly among the EDs. Use of opioid agonists showed the widest variation (16% to 72%), although use of dihydroergotamine (5% to 16%), prochlorperazine (32% to 59%), and adjunct diphenhydramine with prochlorperazine (42% versus 88%) also varied. CONCLUSION: Great institutional variability exists among US EDs in the parenteral treatment of patients with isolated benign headache.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Algorithms, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Antiemetics/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Binomial Distribution, Cohort Studies, Confidence Intervals, Dihydroergotamine/therapeutic use, Diphenhydramine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Drug Therapy, Combination, *Emergency Service, Hospital, Female, Headache/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Health Maintenance Organizations, Hospitals, Rural, Hospitals, University, Humans, Male, Meperidine/therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Prochlorperazine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Retrospective Studies, Tension-Type Headache/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy, United States",-1

9798839,Gabapentin for relief of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.,"Dunevsky A, Perel AB",Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 1998 Sep-Oct;77(5):451-4.,"The use of a recently released anticonvulsant, gabapentin, in the treatment of spasticity in two patients with multiple sclerosis is reported. Gabapentin was chosen because of its GABA-ergic effect and because previously reported studies have shown that it is well tolerated compared with other GABA-mimetic medication. Satisfactory release of spasticity with significant improvement of functional outcome was noted in both cases. Both patients were first treated with gabapentin for one month at 300 mg per day and then, with no reported side-effects, at 400 mg per day. Before treatment, spasticity (graded with modified Ashworth Scale) in one patient was 3 for left lower and 2 for right lower limbs, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was 7; ambulation was limited to a few steps with a standard walker. After two weeks of treatment, spasticity was 2 and 1 for the left and right lower limbs, respectively. At three-month intervals, spasticity was +1 for left and 1 for right lower limbs, and EDSS was 6; the patient could ambulate 75 to 100 m with a standard walker. In the second patient, spasticity before treatment was 2 for both lower and left upper limbs. EDSS was 5.5, and ambulation was confined to 100 m with a cane. Spasticity improved to +1 in lower and 1 in left upper limbs after two weeks and to 1 and normal after three months. At three months, EDSS was 3 and the patient could ambulate for long distances without an assistive device. We suggest that gabapentin can be used effectively to decrease spasticity without significant side effects in patients with multiple sclerosis.","Acetates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Parasympatholytics/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

It is currently used mainly in the anaesthetic and emergency rooms to reverse the effect of exogenous benzodiazepines. Its use in a variety of experimental animal models and in human neuropsychiatric disorders continues to generate a wealth of information on the possible role of the benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor complex in their pathogenesis. In addition, labelled with carbon-11, flumazenil has proved to be one of the most successful positron emission tomography ligands stimulating research on the role of the benzodiazepine receptor in these disorders. This review focuses on the current state of play of flumazenil as a therapeutic or investigative agent in neuropsychiatry, citing also the relevant animal models.","Animals, Antidotes/*pharmacology, Flumazenil/*pharmacology, GABA Modulators/*pharmacology, Humans, Mental Disorders/*drug therapy",-1
9099528,Influence of common drugs and related factors on stroke outcome.,Goldstein LB,Curr Opin Neurol. 1997 Feb;10(1):52-7.,"Laboratory studies show that recovery after brain injury can be influenced by drugs that affect certain central neurotransmitters. The effects of these drugs may be either beneficial or harmful. Although issues related to drug dose, the timing of interventions relative to the deficit, and the nature of concomitant experience or training may be critical, preliminary clinical studies suggest that similar drug effects may occur in humans recovering from stroke. Recognition of these data is important because many of the drugs that may impair recovery are commonly prescribed to stroke patients for the treatment of coincident medical conditions and should be avoided if possible. Pharmacotherapy to enhance recovery may be possible in the future.","Animals, Brain/drug effects/physiopathology, Central Nervous System Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity, Cerebral Infarction/*physiopathology, Humans, Nerve Regeneration/drug effects/physiology, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Neuronal Plasticity/drug effects/physiology, Neurotransmitter Agents/*physiology, Psychotropic Drugs/*pharmacology/toxicity",-1

Menarche, menses, pregnancy, menopause and the use of exogenous oestrogen-containing medications frequently alter baseline headache patterns. Changing patterns of headache in women may be linked to alterations in levels of sex hormones. Sex hormones directly influence headache by affecting the activity of a variety of neurochemicals important for headache, including serotonin (5HT).

10797404,Flexor reflexes in chronic spinal cord injury triggered by imposed ankle rotation.,"Schmit BD, McKenna-Cole A, Rymer WZ",Muscle Nerve. 2000 May;23(5):793-803.,"Hypersensitivity of the flexor reflexes to input from force-sensitive muscle afferents may contribute to the prevalence and severity of muscle spasms in patients with spinal cord injuries. In the present study, we triggered flexor reflexes with constant-velocity ankle movements into end-range dorsiflexion and plantarflexion positions in 8 individuals with spinal cord injuries. We found that all 8 subjects had coordinated increases in flexion torque at the hip and ankle following externally imposed plantarflexion movements at the ankle. In addition, end-range dorsiflexion movements also triggered flexor reflexes in 3 subjects, although greater loads were required to trigger such reflexes using dorsiflexion movements (compared to plantarflexion movements). These three-joint reflex torque patterns triggered by ankle movement were broadly comparable to flexion withdrawal responses elicited by electrocutaneous stimuli applied to a toe, although the amplitude of the torque response was generally lower. We conclude that excitation of muscle and joint-related afferents induced by end-range movements may be responsible for exaggerated flexion reflex responses in spinal cord injury.","Adult, Ankle Joint/*physiopathology, Electromyography, Electrophysiology/instrumentation/methods, Hip Joint/physiopathology, Humans, Leg, Middle Aged, Movement, Muscle, Skeletal/physiopathology, Reflex, Rotation, Spasm/etiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*physiopathology, Torque",-1

Patients with this syndrome regulate body temperature poorly, if at all. Recently, a patient was referred to us who had clinical evidence of poikilothermia syndrome, as well as long-standing multiple sclerosis. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance scanning failed to identify a hypothalamic lesion. The patient was gradually warmed to sweating, and then cooled to vasoconstriction and shivering. The core-temperature thresholds triggering each defence were calculated, after compensating for the changes in skin temperature. The calculated sweating threshold was 38.3 degrees C (normal: 37.0 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The vasoconstriction threshold was 34.4 degrees C (normal: 36.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The sweating-to-vasoconstriction interthreshold range was thus approximately 4 degrees C, which is between 10 and 20 times the normal value. The shivering threshold was 31.8 degrees C (normal: 35.6 +/- 0.3 degrees C). The vasoconstriction-to-shivering range was thus approximately 2.5 degrees C which is more than twice the normal value. The pattern of thermoregulatory failure in this patient resembled that resulting from general anaesthesia.","Body Temperature, *Body Temperature Regulation, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/complications/physiopathology, Shivering, Sweating, Syndrome",-1

CASE SUMMARY: An 86-year-old white woman was admitted to the hospital for headaches and diplopia. On hospital day 3, the patient received zolpidem 5 mg and, approximately two hours later, became restless, disoriented, and physically agitated. She was treated with haloperidol and was restrained for her safety. The patient's symptoms resolved by day 5, and she had no recollection of the incident. No rechallenge was attempted. DISCUSSION: Pharmacokinetic factors may play an important role in zolpidem-induced adverse drug reactions. Elderly women can achieve up to a 63% higher serum concentration than men. The patient in our report had factors such as age, gender, and hypoalbuminemia, which may have increased the maximum concentration and the AUC of zolpidem and possibly increased her risk of an adverse reaction. CONCLUSIONS: This case, along with previous reports, warrants the cautious use of zolpidem. Clinicians should be aware that a majority of these reactions occur in women. It appears that the reactions are concentration dependent, therefore, dosage reductions should be made in elderly patients and those with hepatic insufficiency.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aging/metabolism, Area Under Curve, Delirium/*chemically induced, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics, Pyridines/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics",-1

In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, 180 women received granisetron 40 micrograms kg-1, droperidol 20 micrograms kg-1, or granisetron 40 micrograms kg-1 plus droperidol 20 micrograms kg-1 (n = 60 of each) intravenously immediately before induction of anaesthesia. A standard general anaesthetic technique and post-operative analgesia were used. A complete response, defined as no post-operative nausea and vomiting and no need for another rescue anti-emetic, during the first 24 h after anaesthesia occurred in 88%, 60% and 98% of patients who had received granisetron, droperidol and granisetron plus droperidol (P < 0.05; overall Fisher's exact probability test). No clinically important adverse events due to the drugs were observed in any of the groups. In summary, prophylactic use of combined granisetron and droperidol is more effective than each drug alone for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting in female patients undergoing thyroidectomy.","Adult, Antiemetics/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Dopamine Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Double-Blind Method, Droperidol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Granisetron/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Humans, Middle Aged, Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting/*prevention & control, Prospective Studies, Serotonin Antagonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, *Thyroidectomy",-1

No family history or personal antecedent, of focal or generalized dystonia was found and the dystonia was not seen in any of the four patients pre-operatively, or during the immediate post-operative period. Only ill-defined lumbar 'discomfort', unlike their pre-operative lumbago, was reported by the patients, before and during the occurrence of the pathologic trunk posture on standing. Asymmetric lumbar muscle tonic contraction and hypertrophy was found on physical examination. In all patients, the kyphoscoliosis was maximal when standing, partially disappeared when seated, and completely when lying down. One patient responded well to clonazepam, but the other three showed no improvement with either clonazepam or local injections of botulinum toxin; L-dopa was ineffective in all cases, and trihexiphenidyle in three.","Adult, Back Pain, Dystonia/*etiology, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Intervertebral Disc Displacement/*surgery, Kyphosis/*etiology, Laminectomy/*adverse effects, Lumbar Vertebrae, Male, Posture, Scoliosis/etiology",-1

These drugs, not specifically designed for the treatment of MS, may include antispastic agents (e.g. baclofen), drugs to reduce tremor (e.g. clonazepam), anticholinergics (e.g. oxybutynin) which relieve urinary symptoms, anti-epileptics (e.g. carbamazepine) to control neuralgia, stimulants to reduce fatigue (e.g. amantadine), and antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine) to treat depression. The treatment of acute relapses or exacerbations is dominated by corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone. The most active area of current investigation is the development of drugs which will inhibit the progression of the disease process itself, and in this category the beta- and alpha-interferons are the most effective drugs currently available, although many new treatments are currently in trials, including immunoglobulin, copolymer-1. bovine myelin, T-cell receptor (TCR) peptide vaccines, platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonists, matrix metallo-proteinase inhibitors, campath-1, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF).","Adjuvants, Immunologic/*therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Cholinergic Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Humans, Interferon-beta/*therapeutic use, Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy, Parasympatholytics/*therapeutic use",-1

Patients who have suffered this pontine lesion generally have preserved vertical eye movements and movement of the eyelids (blinking), this being their only means of responding to the outside world. A survey was conducted of 44 people diagnosed with LIS, all of them belonging to the Association of Locked-in Syndrome (ALIS) of France. Results of this survey showed that LIS was equally frequent in men and women (51.2% vs. 48.1%) and had occurred at any age between 22-77 years of age (normally between 41-52 years, the mean age being 46.79 years). The average time that transpired post-insult was 71.35 months. The principal cause of LIS was stroke (86.4%), with traumatic brain injury (TBI) being a distant second cause with an incidence of only 13.6%. The diagnosis of LIS was usually made around the middle of the second month after onset (mean of 78.76 days). The principal treatments, when present, were pharmacological and physiotherapy. However, 47.1% of the patients were not receiving treatment of any kind at the time of the survey. Neuropsychologically, 86% had a good attentional level, 97.6% were temporally oriented and 76.7% could read; 18.6% reported memory problems and 24% showed visual deficit (found mainly in patients with LIS originated by TBI); 47.5% reported a good mood state and 12.5% reported feeling depressed; 61.1% reported having sexual desire, but only 30% maintained sexual relations; 78% were capable of emitting sounds and 65.8% could communicate without technical aid; 73.2% enjoyed going out and 81% met with friends at least twice a month. Only 14.3% participated in social activities and 23.8% watched television regularly. Nearly 100% of the patients reported being sensitive to touch to any part of their bodies.

These drugs have proven efficacy as add-on therapy in patients with difficult-to-treat partial epilepsy, as 20-50% of patients treated in add-on trials experienced a seizure reduction of >or=50%. Relatively few trials have been conducted to evaluate these drugs as monotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. In the monotherapy trials that have been conducted, the newer drugs were often as efficacious as conventional drugs, and their tolerability was often better. However, the methodology of these trials can be criticised. Because of the relative lack of robust data for the newer agents, the conventional drugs have thus far maintained their status as first-line monotherapy. However, when first-line monotherapy fails, an alternative drug has to be chosen from the available conventional and newer drugs. This article aims to give detailed background information on the newer AEDs in order to enable physicians to make a rational choice from the available drugs for individual patients. Data are provided for the different newer AEDs on mechanisms of action; efficacy in refractory partial epilepsy, newly diagnosed epilepsy in adults and generalised seizure types; adverse effects; pharmacokinetics; and use in special patient categories.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Drug Evaluation, Drugs, Investigational, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Humans, Patient Selection, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHODS: The study included 60 patients with JNCL; their mean age was 16.5 years (range 5-33). The age at onset of epilepsy, type of seizures, effect of the first AED on seizures, and the current seizure frequency and AED therapy were studied. The side effects of the AEDs were also clarified. RESULTS: Fifty of the 60 patients had epilepsy. Patients' first epileptic seizure occurred at a mean age of 10.0 years (range 5-16), the most common type being generalized seizures. As the first AED tried, valproate (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG) appeared equally effective, with 80% of the patients responding to these AEDs. During the study year, the median seizure frequency was four seizures a year (range 0-120), and 72% of the patients had good or satisfactory seizure control (0-6 seizures a year). In the different AED therapy groups, the proportion of patients with good or satisfactory seizure control ranged from 25% to 100%. LTG in monotherapy or in combination with clonazepam (CZP) was superior to other AEDs or combinations, but VPA also seemed effective. Adverse effects leading to the discontinuation of an AED were observed in 25% of the patients, most frequently in patients receiving phenobarbital (PB). No patient receiving LTG had to discontinue the drug due to adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Epilepsy in JNCL can usually be successfully treated with the current AEDs. In Finnish patients with JNCL, treatment is based on LTG, or, secondarily, VPA. In combination therapy, CZP seems a valuable add-on AED.","Adolescent, Adult, Age of Onset, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Clonazepam/therapeutic use, Comorbidity, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/epidemiology, Female, Finland/epidemiology, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses/*complications/epidemiology, Phenobarbital/therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome, Triazines/therapeutic use, Valproic Acid/therapeutic use",-1

Pallidotomy has been shown to be an effective treatment for medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed bilateral microelectrode guided-stereotactic pallidotomies targeted at globus pallidum internus (GPi) to treat a 13-year-old patient diagnosed with Westphal variant of HD with intractable generalized dystonia and parkinsonism. RESULTS: Intraoperative microelectrode recordings of GPi cells showed a relatively low firing rate, 29 +/- 14 Hz, with most neurons showing pauses. Acutely, after surgery, limb dystonia mildly improved but trunk dystonia persisted. Postoperative follow up 3 months later showed minimal clinical improvement in dystonic features with marked worsening of spasticity. CONCLUSION: In our case, bilateral pallidotomy produced modest palliative functional improvement in dystonic features. Cellular firing patterns were markedly different than in PD and were similar to those found in dystonia.","Adolescent, Dystonia/etiology/physiopathology/*surgery, Fatal Outcome, Female, Globus Pallidus/*surgery, Humans, Huntington Disease/*complications/physiopathology/surgery, Microsurgery/methods, Severity of Illness Index, Stereotaxic Techniques",-1

LTG was initiated in doses of 25 or 50 mg daily in 69 patients with newly diagnosed or poorly controlled epilepsy and was increased monthly in 50-mg increments until the patient became seizure-free for at least 6 months or developed adverse effects that abated after a reduction in dosage. LTG and other antiepileptic drug (AED) concentrations were measured at each clinic visit but were not supplied to the investigator examining the patients. Overall, 19 patients either withdrew due to lack of efficacy or defaulted from the clinic. Of the remaining 50 patients, 32 (19 monotherapy, 13 polytherapy) became seizure-free at widely varying daily LTG doses (median 200 mg, range 25-850 mg) and concentrations (median 3.8 mg/L, range 1.4-18.7 mg/L).

We describe a man with tonic spasms associated with a lacunar infarction in the right ventral pons. CASE DESCRIPTION: Involuntary tonic spasms of a paretic limb developed acutely in a 69-year-old hypertensive man with a clinical presentation of pure motor hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a lacunar infarction of the ventral pons. There was no evidence for carotid occlusive disease. An electroencephalogram recorded during the movements showed no abnormality. The abnormal movements responded well to treatment with oral diazepam. CONCLUSIONS: A brain stem lacunar infarction may be associated with involuntary tonic limb spasms clinically similar to those reported as paroxysmal symptoms of multiple sclerosis.","Aged, *Brain Stem, Cerebral Infarction/*complications/diagnosis, Diazepam/therapeutic use, Electroencephalography, Hemiplegia/etiology, Humans, *Leg, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/*etiology",-1
12837566,The KEEPER trial: levetiracetam adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in an open-label community-based study.,"Morrell MJ, Leppik I, French J, Ferrendelli J, Han J, Magnus L",Epilepsy Res. 2003 May;54(2-3):153-61.,"PURPOSE: Three randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of levetiracetam, a new antiepileptic medication, as add-on therapy for partial-onset seizures. The purpose of this study was to gather additional safety and efficacy data on levetiracetam in the real-world setting of community-based practice. METHODS: This was a phase IV prospective, open-label, multicenter, community-based trial. A total of 1030 patients (intent-to-treat (ITT) population) at least 16 years old (mean, 42.2 years) with partial-onset seizures were enrolled by over 300 investigators. Patients whose partial-onset seizures were inadequately controlled on their current medications had levetiracetam 500 mg bid added to their regimens. The levetiracetam dose was increased by 500 mg bid at the end of weeks 2 and 4 to a maximum dose of 1500 mg bid, unless the patient had been seizure-free during the preceding 2-week period. The dose was then to remain the same for 12 weeks. The main outcome measures were reduction in seizure frequency, global evaluation scale (GES), and adverse events. RESULTS: During the 16 weeks of the trial, 57.9% (542/936) experienced at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of partial-onset seizures, 40.1% (375/936) experienced at least a 75% reduction, and 20% (187/936) demonstrated a 100% seizure reduction. During the last 6 weeks of the study, 66.7% (500/750) experienced at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of partial seizures, 52.4% (393/750) experienced at least a 75% reduction, and 42.1% (316/750) demonstrated a 100% seizure reduction. On the investigator-completed clinical impression rating (GES), 74.3% (734/988) of patients were considered improved, with 37% of patients showing marked improvement. The most common adverse events were somnolence, dizziness, asthenia, and headache; these events were predominantly mild-to-moderate in nature. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide further evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam as adjunctive treatment for partial-onset seizures.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Community Health Services/statistics & numerical data, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsies, Partial/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Piracetam/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Prospective Studies",-1
12269842,"Gastroesophageal reflux in children: pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and role of proton pump inhibitors in treatment.","Gold BD, Freston JW",Paediatr Drugs. 2002;4(10):673-85.,"A substantial percentage of infants, children and adolescents experience gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its accompanying symptoms, as well as disease complications. The diagnosis of GERD in children is made based upon the child's history, and data derived primarily from pH monitoring tests and endoscopy. In those children with confirmed reflux disease, the options for management parallel those recommended in adult patients, with the first step consisting of lifestyle changes. Surgical procedures may also be performed; however, these are rarely recommended prior to an adequate course of pharmacologic therapy, and appropriate case selection is important. Among the current pharmacotherapeutic options available in the US, the prokinetic agents and the acid-inhibitory agents (histamine-2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) are the most widely used. The clinical utility of the prokinetic agents has been limited by the recent withdrawal of cisapride from the US marketplace and the potential for irreversible central nervous system complications with metoclopramide. Numerous clinical studies performed in adults, and several studies involving children, have demonstrated that the proton pump inhibitors are more effective than the histamine-2 receptor antagonists in the relief of GERD symptoms and healing of erosive esophagitis. In children, omeprazole and lansoprazole may be administered as the intact oral capsule, or in those who are unable or unwilling to swallow, the granule contents of the capsule may be mixed with soft foods (e.g. apple sauce) or fruit drinks/liquid dietary supplements prior to oral administration with no detrimental effects on pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, or pharmacodynamics. Studies performed with omeprazole and lansoprazole in children have shown pharmacokinetic parameters that closely resemble those observed in adults. In over a decade of use in adults, the proton pump inhibitor class of agents has been found to have a good safety profile. Studies involving children have also shown these agents to be well tolerated. In numerous drug-drug interaction studies performed with these two proton pump inhibitors, relatively few clinically significant interactions have been observed.","Animals, Child, Drug Interactions, Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Gastroesophageal Reflux/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology, Humans, *Proton Pump Inhibitors",-1

10819089,Treatment options in postherpetic neuralgia.,"Bonezzi C, Demartini L",Acta Neurol Scand Suppl. 1999;173:25-35; discussion 48-52.,"Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a separate disease entity that represents a complication of acute herpes zoster. PHN, involving aberrant somatosensory processing in the peripheral and/or central nervous system, is considered to be a chronic neuropathic pain, frequently unresponsive to all treatment modalities. Despite the clinical trial data demonstrating successful pain relief with several drug regimens, the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain is difficult, particularly in PHN. Response to therapy is generally inhomogeneous. Some patients experience long-term pain control with either topical or oral monotherapy with antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or opioids. Other PHN patients, such as those suffering pain due to central nervous system lesions, are extraordinarily refractory to all measures. This article will review current treatments--tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, local anesthetics, clonidine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-antagonists, and opioids and focus on mechanism-based pharmacologic interventions. Pharmacologic approaches can be classified into three groups: 1) drugs that act topically in the affected skin area; 2) drugs that act on nerve excitability and conduction in sensory axons; and 3) drugs that act on neural damage related synaptic changes. This last group is the only pain treatment option related to central denervation. To date, the treatment of PHN has relied on the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), which represent the most comprehensively studied medications for this pain syndrome. Clinical data indicate that TCAs are effective analgesics in approximately 50% of patients; these drugs have been recommended as first-line agents for all neuropathic pain syndromes except trigeminal neuralgia, but are frequently contraindicated or poorly tolerated in elderly patients with PHN. If monotherapy fails, a mechanism- and/or symptom-based multidrug regimen can be used. There is also consistent support for intravenous and topical lidocaine, intravenous ketamine, carbamazepine, and opioids. Gabapentin, a new anticonvulsant, can be considered a first-line oral medication for PHN based on the efficacy and safety results of a recently completed double-blind trial. In addition to positive effects on PHN, sleep, mood, and overall quality of life were significantly improved.","Analgesics/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects, Anticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/administration & dosage/adverse effects, Clinical Trials as Topic, Clonidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects, Herpes Zoster/*drug therapy, Humans, N-Methylaspartate/antagonists & inhibitors, Neuralgia/*drug therapy",-1
9847055,Felbamate: clinical and molecular aspects of a unique antiepileptic drug.,"Brown WM, Aiken SP",Crit Rev Neurobiol. 1998;12(3):205-22.,"Felbamate was launched in 1993 in the U.S. as a ""new generation"" antiepileptic drug (AED) with a unique mechanism of action. It proved efficacious in patients refractory to other AEDs and was particularly beneficial in children suffering from Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, being the first drug shown to be effective at treating this condition in controlled trials. Following the occurrence of rare cases of aplastic anemia and of hepatic failure associated with the use of felbamate during early 1994, a ""black-box"" warning was added to the drug's package insert. Despite this, felbamate continues to be used in many patients, although not as a first-line treatment. Felbamate's dual mechanism of action--enhancing the GABA system while inhibiting excitatory amino acid responses--may explain its efficacy in a broad range of epileptic patients. A better understanding of this mechanism may lead to the development of felbamate-like drugs with a better side effect profile.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Resistance, Epilepsy/drug therapy, Humans, Intellectual Disability/drug therapy, Phenylcarbamates, Propylene Glycols/adverse effects/*chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Syndrome",-1

Its mechanism of action is uncertain but it exhibits a unique profile of anticonvulsant activity in models of chronic epilepsy. Three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials enrolling 904 patients with refractory partial epilepsy have demonstrated the efficacy of LEV as adjunctive therapy, with a responder rate (> or = 50% reduction in seizure frequency) of 28-41%. Long-term efficacy studies suggest retention rates of 60% after one year, with 13% of patients seizure-free for six months of the study and 8% seizure-free for one year. Adverse effects of LEV, including somnolence, lethargy and dizziness, were generally mild and the frequency of incidents was not significantly different between the active treatment and placebo groups in clinical trials. LEV has no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions (PKI) with other AEDs, or with commonly prescribed medications. Preliminary data suggest that LEV has efficacy in primary generalised epilepsy and further randomised trials are under way. The combination of potent antiepileptic properties with a relatively mild adverse effect profile makes LEV an attractive adjunctive therapy for partial seizures.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Drug Evaluation, Drug Interactions, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Humans, Long-Term Care, Piracetam/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Recurrence, Treatment Outcome",-1
14523750,Intrathecal baclofen therapy for stroke-related spasticity.,Francisco GE,Top Stroke Rehabil. 2001 Spring;8(1):36-46.,"Intrathecal baclofen (ITB) therapy is a widely recognized management technique for severe, disabling spasticity in individuals with cerebral palsy and spinal and brain injuries. Its utility in the stroke population has only been recognized recently. Unlike the aforementioned patient populations, many stroke survivors are ambulatory and are able to maintain a certain degree of functional independence through compensatory use of the uninvolved limbs. Clinicians often fail to recognize the potential enhancement in the function of these individuals if they gain better control of their spastic limbs. Other spasticity treatments, such as oral medications and neurolytic procedures, offer the advantage of being nonsurgical; however, not every stroke patient will respond well to them. Some patients may not tolerate the systemic side effects of oral medications, such as drowsiness and sedation. In patients with severe multilimb spasticity, phenol and even high doses of botulinum toxin may not adequately control spasticity. ITB therapy offers the advantage of effectively decreasing severe, diffuse spasticity without causing untoward effects on arousal and cognition. This article will review the efficacy of ITB therapy in treating spasticity and enhancing function in stroke survivors.",MISSING,-1

12153333,New and emerging prophylactic agents for migraine.,"Krymchantowski AV, Bigal ME, Moreira PF",CNS Drugs. 2002;16(9):611-34.,"Frequent, severe and long-lasting migraine attacks require prophylaxis. Established drugs used for the prevention of migraine such as beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), calcium channel antagonists, antidepressants and others have an unknown mode of action in migraine. Their prophylactic effect in migraine was discovered by chance in clinical practice when these drugs were used for other purposes. Recently, research into the mechanisms of migraine and the progressive recognition that cortical hyperexcitability and an imbalance between neuronal inhibition [mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)] and excitation (mediated by excitatory amino acids) may play an important role in migraine pathophysiology have lead to the identification of potential new agents for the prevention of migraine attacks. This paper reviews the recent literature on these new agents. A search was conducted using MEDLINE from 1998 to November 2001 with the following search terms: migraine, preventive, prophylactic and treatment. Headache textbooks edited in 2000 and 2001 were also used. After analysing the available controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies as well as abstracts, divalproex sodium (valproate semisodium) can be recommended for the prevention of migraine. Lamotrigine may be useful for preventing aura associated with migraine, and topiramate seems a promising option pending trials with more patients, which are currently underway. Riboflavin (which is possibly involved in improving neuronal energy production) appears to be a promising agent, although comparisons with established prophylactic medications are needed. Gabapentin, magnesium, lisinopril and botulinum toxin A have recently been suggested to be effective; however, at present, there are insufficient rigorous and reliable controlled data on these drugs for them to be indicated for such use. Emerging options such as tiagabine, levetiracetam, zonisamide and petasites may all be useful, but controlled data are required to confirm their efficacy. The anti-asthma medication montelukast was found to be effective in an open trial, but ineffective in a recently completed controlled trial. There is an expectation that modern neuroscience will soon provide more efficacious and better tolerated prophylactic medications for migraine.","Animals, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy/*prevention & control, Treatment Outcome",-1

12698831,Mechanisms and management of an incomplete epidural block for cesarean section.,"Portnoy D, Vadhera RB",Anesthesiol Clin North America. 2003 Mar;21(1):39-57.,"Epidural blockade is an important option for anesthesia in parturients undergoing abdominal delivery. Despite the multiple benefits of this method, there is at least one significant downside--a relatively high occurrence of unsatisfactory anesthesia that requires intervention. Depending on the presumed mechanism of epidural block failure and other clinically relevant factors (e.g., timing of diagnosis, urgency of the procedure, and so forth), certain effective measures are recommended to successfully manage this demanding situation. In general, it is important to make every effort to make the pre-existing epidural effective or replace it with another regional technique, because overall, regional anesthesia is associated with significantly lower maternal mortality. It is important to identify a dysfunctional epidural block preoperatively before a maximum volume of local anesthetic has been administered. If catheter manipulation does not produce substantial improvement, and there is no time constraint, it is safe and reasonable to replace the epidural catheter. However, risks associated with excessive volume of local anesthetic should be kept in mind. Additional epidural injections or a second catheter placement might be considered under special circumstances. Single-shot spinal anesthesia after a failed epidural may provide fast onset and reliable surgical anesthesia. Available data, although limited and contradictory, suggest the possibility of unpredictably high or total spinal anesthesia. Many authors, however, believe that appropriate precautions and modifications in technique make this a safe alternative. These modifications include limiting the amount of epidural local anesthetic administered when diagnosing a nonfunctioning epidural and decreasing the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic by 20% to 30%. If there is no documented block when the spinal is inserted, and more than 30 minutes have passed from the last epidural dose, it is probably safe to use a normal dose of local anesthetic. Continuous spinal anesthesia with a macro catheter might be a dependable alternative, particularly if large amounts of local anesthetic have already been used or the patient's airway is a cause for concern. Although there are no reports of combined spinal epidural anesthesia being used in this context, it would appear to be an attractive alternative. It allows the anesthesiologist to give smaller doses intrathecally, while still offering the flexibility of augmenting the block if needed. When inadequate epidural block becomes apparent during surgery there are limited alternatives. Depending on the origin and the pattern of inadequate anesthesia, options may include psychological support, supplementation with a variety of inhalational and intravenous agents, and local anesthetic infiltration. Induction of general anesthesia is typically left as a backup option, but must be strongly considered if the patient continues to have pain/discomfort.","*Anesthesia, Epidural/methods, *Anesthesia, Obstetrical/methods, Anesthesia, Spinal, *Cesarean Section, Female, Humans, *Nerve Block/methods, Pregnancy, Risk Factors",-1

Epub 2003 Apr 8.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical course of quinine-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and review all previous cases reported in the medical literature. DESIGN: Case report/literature review. SETTING: University teaching hospital medical ICU. PATIENTS: One patient in whom thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, intravascular hemolysis, DIC, and acute renal failure temporally followed the ingestion of quinine. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a computerized free-text MEDLINE database search from 1969 to 2000 using the keywords quinine and thrombocytopenia, quinine and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and quinine and disseminated intravascular coagulation. STUDY SELECTION: All reported cases and reviews of quinine-induced thrombocytopenia, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and DIC were reviewed. DIC was distinguished from quinine-induced thrombocytopenia or quinine-induced HUS based on the presence of abnormal clotting times, elevated fibrin degradation products, and/or elevated D-dimer levels. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifteen previous patients were found to meet the criteria for DIC temporally related to the recent ingestion of quinine. The clinical course and laboratory abnormalities documented for each case are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Quinine-induced DIC is a distinct clinical entity, which may present as unexplained thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, or renal failure. In susceptible patients, the immune response to quinine may result in the production of not only anti-platelet antibodies but also antibodies against leukocytes, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells. Furthermore, the varying patterns and specificities of antibody production in an individual patient may result in a spectrum of clinical disease from mild, transient thrombocytopenia to overt intravascular hemolysis, renal failure, coagulopathy, and DIC. Early recognition of quinine-induced DIC is paramount, as this diagnosis affords a better prognosis than other adult forms of HUS or DIC.","Acute Kidney Injury/chemically induced, Adult, Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use, Autoantibodies/drug effects, Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*chemically, induced/diagnosis/immunology/therapy, Erythrocyte Transfusion, Female, Humans, Immunoglobulin G/drug effects, Immunoglobulin M/drug effects, Leg, Muscle Cramp/drug therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects/immunology, Prognosis, Quinine/*adverse effects/immunology, Renal Dialysis, Respiratory Insufficiency/chemically induced, Treatment Outcome",-1

X-linked inherited ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most frequent urea cycle disorder. Many of the hemizygous males die during the neonatal period. Women, who are mostly healthy carriers, can also develop symptomatic hyperammonemia. DESIGN: Case study. SETTING: Intensive care unit and internal medicine unit at a university hospital. PATIENTS: The 20-yr-old female propositus was hospitalized for unexplained coma. She had a history of headaches, recurrent vomiting, specific anorexia for high-protein foods, and an acute neurologic crisis with alleged food poisoning 8 yrs before. The present episode began with psychiatric symptoms and seizures treated by diazepam and valproate. This unexplained coma, associated with respiratory alkalosis and major brain swelling on brain computed tomography scan, revealed hyperammonemia leading to the diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration and treatment with sodium benzoate and phenylbutyrate improved the situation. However, the patient had some neurologic sequelae. DNA studies have disclosed a pathogenic mutation in the ornithine transcarbamylase gene of the patient, her mother, and her sister. For the mother, the disease was overlooked despite the onset of unusual headaches and neurologic signs that mimicked a cerebral tumor 12 yrs before. The 28-yr-old sister of the propositus has always been asymptomatic, even during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of urea cycle disorder should be considered in any patient with unexplained neurologic and psychiatric disorders with selective anorexia, even in adulthood.

A prerequisite for using any scale is a knowledge of its characteristics and limitations, as these will play a part in analysing and interpreting the data. Despite the current emphasis on treating spasticity, clinicians rarely measure it. OBJECTIVES: To determine the validity and the reliability of the Ashworth and modified Ashworth Scales. STUDY DESIGN: A theoretical analysis following a structured literature review (key words: Ashworth; Spasticity; Measurement) of 40 papers selected from the BIDS-EMBASE, First Search and Medline databases. CONCLUSIONS: The application of both scales would suggest that confusion exists on their characteristics and limitations as measures of spasticity. Resistance to passive movement is a complex measure that will be influenced by many factors, only one of which could be spasticity. The Ashworth Scale (AS) can be used as an ordinal level measure of resistance to passive movement, but not spasticity. The modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) will need to be treated as a nominal level measure of resistance to passive movement until the ambiguity between the '1' and '1+' grades is resolved. The reliability of the scales is better in the upper limb. The AS may be more reliable than the MAS. There is a need to standardize methods to apply these scales in clinical practice and research.","Arm, *Disabled Persons, Humans, Movement, Muscle Spasticity/*classification, Reference Values, Reproducibility of Results, Severity of Illness Index",-1

CASE SUMMARY: A ventilator-dependent 71-year-old man presented with pain caused by metastatic lung cancer. Transdermal fentanyl therapy was titrated to 200 micrograms/h. Two days later a continuous morphine infusion was initiated because of frequent administration of oral morphine solution for breakthrough pain. The patient became progressively less responsive and began exhibiting involuntary muscle hyperactivity thought to represent breakthrough pain. Despite the inability to assess pain control effectively in this unresponsive patient, the morphine infusion rate was increased from 22 to 717 mg/h within 7 days. No change in muscle hyperactivity was observed. DISCUSSION: Over the last decade involuntary muscle hyperactivity has been documented as an adverse effect of chronic opioid therapy. The literature describing the incidence of this toxicity, possible risk factors for its development, and recommendations for its management are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of muscle hyperactivity in an unresponsive patient receiving chronic opioid therapy may represent opioid toxicity. Recommendations for managing opioid-induced muscle hyperactivity include reduction of the opioid dosage and/or administration of clonazepam therapy.","Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous/physiopathology/secondary, Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Chronic Disease, Fentanyl/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Humans, Hyperkinesis, Infusions, Intravenous, Lung Neoplasms/physiopathology/secondary, Male, Morphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Muscle, Smooth/*drug effects/physiology, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology",-1

METHODS: Twenty-two patients with fibromyalgia were studied in a 2-month, double-blind, crossover trial of amitriptyline (25 mg/day) versus placebo. Nocturnal EEGs were conducted on 2 consecutive nights at baseline and at the end of each 2-month treatment period. RESULTS: Six patients (27%) had a clinical response to amitriptyline, while none responded to placebo (P = 0.02). Treatment with amitriptyline or placebo did not result in any changes in the alpha ratings during NREM sleep. Only 8 patients (36%) exhibited the alpha NREM sleep anomaly at baseline. Those patients reported more sleep difficulty, but otherwise were clinically indistinguishable from those without this EEG sleep anomaly. Lower baseline alpha NREM sleep ratings were seen in responders to amitriptyline than in nonresponders, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The alpha NREM sleep anomaly is present in only a small proportion of patients with fibromyalgia. It does not correlate with disease severity nor is it affected by treatment with amitriptyline. A larger sample size will be needed to adequately assess the value of this sleep anomaly in predicting the response to amitriptyline.","Adult, Alpha Rhythm, Amitriptyline/*therapeutic use, Automatic Data Processing, Double-Blind Method, *Electroencephalography, Female, Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy/*physiopathology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Sleep/*physiology",-1
10507712,Activated cytokine production in patients with accidental hypothermia.,"Aibiki M, Maekawa S, Nishiyama T, Seki K, Yokono S",Resuscitation. 1999 Aug;41(3):263-8.,"We have demonstrated recently that therapeutic moderate hypothermia of 32-33 degrees C, induced by surface cooling under the administration of narcotics, sedatives and muscle relaxant, suppresses cytokine production after traumatic brain injury. We present here the first documented case report of augmented cytokine production in two accidental hypothermia patients, unconscious 84- (acute immersion) and 87- (non-immersion) year-old women, whose rectal temperatures were below 28 degrees C. The victims were artificially ventilated after sedation with midazolam and buprenorphine in accordance with our protocol. Rewarming at the rate of approximately 1 degrees C/h was done by blowing forced-air with appropriate fluid resuscitation. Plasma interleukin(IL)-6 and/or IL-8 levels were measured using ELISA in the patients. In both patients, plasma IL-6 levels on admission were already elevated and the cytokine levels further increased during and after the rewarming period. In the patient with the poorer prognosis, the plasma IL-8 level on admission was not elevated remarkably but after rewarming the level rose significantly. Augmented IL-6 production in accidental hypothermia was sustained for 6 days in the patient with the poorer prognosis but not in the subject with good recovery, who was treated with anti-thrombin III in the early phase. Since the mechanisms for developing accidental hypothermia were different, simple comparisons between the two cases should be limited. But, these findings may suggest a need for testing a hypothesis whether cytokine modulation could be a therapeutic approach worthy of consideration. The results presented here also suggest that in hypothermia, changes in cytokine release may vary depending on procedures such as the anesthetic drugs used, the duration of the therapy, or the rate of rewarming from hypothermia.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Biological Markers/blood, Cytokines/*biosynthesis, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Female, Humans, Hypothermia/*blood/therapy, Interleukin-6/*blood, Interleukin-8/*blood, Prognosis, *Rewarming, Sensitivity and Specificity",-1
12844458,Chronic pelvic pain.,FitzGerald MP,Curr Womens Health Rep. 2003 Aug;3(4):327-33.,"The topic of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) has long been a frustrating one for physicians and patients alike, with difficulties in diagnosis and management leading to delays in recovery. Recent insights into the neurobiology of chronic pain disorders and into mechanisms of visceral pain suggest that significant advances in treatment of CPP are likely to occur during coming years. These insights suggest that we consider directing our treatment efforts away from the visceral organ presumed to be primarily responsible for the CPP and toward treatment of the neurologic mechanisms that sustain chronic pain.","Animals, Causality, Chronic Disease, Female, Humans, Male, Models, Animal, Musculoskeletal Diseases/complications, Pain Threshold, Pelvic Floor/physiopathology, Pelvic Pain/etiology/*physiopathology/therapy, Pelvis/innervation, Rats, Urologic Diseases/complications",-1

METHODS: A postal questionnaire sent to the medical directors of 12 spinal injury units in the USA. RESULTS: A response was received from eight of the 12 units. Chronic pain was considered a significant problem amongst patients with SCI. There was inconsistency of opinion regarding prevalence estimates, investigation and management of chronic pain after SCI; but classification systems for pain were remarkably similar amongst units. Most felt that there was a need for further information, although only one unit said it was presently conducting research into the subject. CONCLUSION: Our survey has demonstrated the uncertainty that exists amongst USA specialists dealing with pain after SCI, and strengthens the case for more research into the subject with a view to developing guidelines for care.","Chronic Disease, Great Britain, Health Surveys, Humans, Pain/classification/epidemiology/physiopathology, Physician Executives, Prevalence, Questionnaires, Spinal Cord Injuries/*physiopathology, Trauma Centers",-1

Eight patients suffering from episodic cluster headache and four suffering from chronic cluster headache were studied. All of them had failed to respond to traditional prophylactic drugs. The design of the study was an open trial. The main parameter for effectiveness was the number of daily attacks. Gabapentin was given at the daily dosage of 900 mg. All patients were pain free after a maximum of 8 days after starting therapy, with a bout duration thus reduced to 16-40% of the average previous bouts (only applies to episodic cluster patients). We hypothesize that the gabaergic action of gabapentin, perhaps combined with other mechanisms, such as calcium channel blockade, may be responsible for its remarkable effects on cluster headache.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Cluster Headache/*drug therapy, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Resistance/physiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

In a preliminary study, dramatic effects of train duration on perception in a patient with right brain stroke were noted. In this study, the mechanisms of train duration on perception of peripheral somatosensory stimuli are examined. Subjects included healthy adults and patients with right brain infarctions. Train duration effects on perception were examined in relation to cerebral infarction, handedness, age, elevated peripheral threshold via bupivacaine, and impaired attention via diazepam or scopolamine. Perceptual thresholds to electrical pulses on the hand decreased as train duration increased, but only over the first several hundred milliseconds. Compared to controls, right brain stroke patients showed much greater lowering of threshold in the affected hand as train duration was extended. Age and bupivacaine elevated thresholds, but had little or no influence on train duration effects. Diazepam and scopolamine had no effect on thresholds. Thresholds were lower in the left than right hand of healthy dextral subjects, irrespective of age. Sinistral subjects had less left/right asymmetry. Increased train duration effect in patients is not explained by a primary elevation in threshold or by impaired vigilance. Lower perceptual thresholds in the left hand of healthy dextral subjects is consistent with right cerebral dominance for externally directed attention.","Adjuvants, Anesthesia/pharmacology, Adult, Aged, Anesthetics, Local/pharmacology, Brain/*physiopathology, Bupivacaine/pharmacology, Consciousness/drug effects/*physiology, Diazepam/pharmacology, Female, Functional Laterality/*physiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Perceptual Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology, Scopolamine Hydrobromide/pharmacology, Sensation Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology, Sensory Thresholds/*drug effects/physiology, Stroke/complications/*physiopathology, Time Factors",-1

The effects of fluparoxan, an alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, on the pharmacodynamic changes induced by clonidine were investigated in this placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-period, cross-over study in 16 healthy male volunteers (aged 19 to 44 years). 2. Subjects received either fluparoxan or placebo, twice-daily for 5 1/2 days (11 doses). One hour after the first and last dose of each treatment period, clonidine (200 micrograms) was infused intravenously over 5 min. 3. Indices of clonidine-mediated pharmacodynamic responses (growth hormone secretion, bradycardia, hypotension, xerostomia and sedation) were taken before and after clonidine infusion. Growth hormone secretion was assessed by quantifying serum growth hormone concentrations; sedation was assessed by both visual analogue scales (VAS) and by a visual psychomotor response meter, measuring critical flicker fusion (CFF). 4. The majority of subjects reported minor adverse events such as lethargy, headache and dry mouth following clonidine infusion. All adverse events were likely to be related to clonidine, as they occurred consistently between treatment groups. Fluparoxan has, however, in previous studies been reported to cause headache and light-headedness. 5. Prior to the clonidine infusion, fluparoxan caused small but statistically significant increases in systolic blood pressure (4 mm Hg) and salivary flow (approximately 30%) after both single and repeated doses. A small increase in heart rate (2 beats min-1) was seen after a single dose which was also statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Administration, Oral, Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Adult, Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Blood Pressure/*drug effects, Bradycardia/chemically induced, Clonidine/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Growth Hormone/metabolism, Heart Rate/*drug effects, Humans, Hypotension/chemically induced, Infusions, Intravenous, Male, Piperoxan/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology, Psychomotor Performance/drug effects, Pyrroles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Xerostomia/chemically induced",-1
12378742,Atovaquone + proguanil: new preparation. Second-line antimalarial combination.,MISSING,Prescrire Int. 2002 Oct;11(61):131-6.,"(1) Quinine, halofantrine and mefloquine are effective treatments for most cases of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. (2) The choice of drug for prevention of P. falciparum malaria in highly endemic regions depends on the risk of chloroquine resistance, and possibly mefloquine resistance. The reference treatments are the chloroquine + proguanil combination, and mefloquine. (3) Marketing authorisation has been granted in France for the atovaquone + proguanil combination, in curative and preventive treatment of P. falciparum malaria. (4) The efficacy of the atovaquone + proguanil combination in uncomplicated malaria is similar to that of other treatments. Some strains of malaria seem to have reduced sensitivity. (5) The atovaquone + proguanil combination is also effective as prophylaxis, but there are no clinical trials showing whether it is equivalent to or better than other preventive treatments in non immune travellers. (6) According to the French licensing terms, atovaquone + proguanil prophylaxis can be stopped 7 days after leaving an endemic area, rather than 3-4 weeks with other drugs. This recommendation is based on weak evidence: mainly on theoretical arguments and on the absence of clinical malaria in some patients with evidence of P. falciparum infection. (7) The atovaquone + proguanil combination is less effective against other Plasmodium species (P. malariae, P. ovale and P. vivax). Chloroquine remains the reference treatment for these forms of malaria, which do not carry a risk of serious complications. (8) There were few adverse events in people taking the atovaquone + proguanil combination during clinical trials. During curative treatment, this combination caused more nausea and vomiting than reference treatments, while, in the prophylactic setting, it had slightly fewer adverse effects than the chloroquine + proguanil combination or mefloquine alone. But the drop out rate was not significantly different between treatment groups. (9) Atovaquone should be taken with food, to improve absorption. (10) The atovaquone + proguanil combination is expensive and is not refunded in France. In contrast, curative treatment with quinine is cheap, and is fully refunded. (11) Mefloquine and quinine remain the treatments of choice for uncomplicated malaria where there is chloroquine resistance. The atovaquone + proguanil combination is useful if mefloquine and quinine are contraindicated; unlike halofantrine, this combination does not carry the risk of serious drug interactions. In the prophylactic setting, the lack of experience with atovaquone means it should only be used as a second line option, after mefloquine, for short-term prophylaxis in areas with a high prevalence of chloroquine resistance.","Antimalarials/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Developing Countries, Drug Approval, Drug Combinations, Drug Costs, Drug Interactions, Drug Resistance, Ethics, Medical, France, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Mefloquine/therapeutic use, Naphthoquinones/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic, use, Phenanthrenes/therapeutic use, Proguanil/administration & dosage/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use, Quinine/therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Travel",-1

9679720,Effect of single-drug therapy on reduction of left atrial size in mild to moderate hypertension: comparison of six antihypertensive agents.,"Gottdiener JS, Reda DJ, Williams DW, Materson BJ, Cushman W, Anderson RJ",Circulation. 1998 Jul 14;98(2):140-8.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac effects of hypertension include increased left ventricular (LV) mass and LV hypertrophy, as well as increased left atrial size, a predictor of stroke and atrial fibrillation. Although literature on reduction of LV mass with antihypertensive therapy is extensive, little information is available on effects of treatment on left atrial size. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 95 to 109 mm Hg) were randomly allocated to treatment with atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, hydrochlorothiazide, or prazosin in a double-masked trial. Two-dimensional targeted M-mode echocardiography was used to assess left atrial size and LV mass at baseline, 8 weeks, and 1 and 2 years. Longitudinal analysis examined changes in left atrial size from the baseline study, statistically adjusting for age, race, pretreatment left atrial size and LV mass, and serial measurements of systolic blood pressure, body weight, urinary sodium excretion, and physical activity score. Without adjustment for covariates, only hydrochlorothiazide was associated with decreases in left atrial size from baseline at 8 weeks (-1.0 +/- 5.2 mm; P=0.052), 1 year (-2.0 +/- 5.1 mm; P=0.02), and 2 years (4.6+/-7.2 mm; P=0.002). After adjustment for effects of covariates, patients with normal left atrial size had greater reduction (-3.3 mm) in left atrial size at 2 years with hydrochlorothiazide than with any other drug. For patients with left atrial enlargement, left atrial size decreased significantly with hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, clonidine, and diltiazem at 1 year and with all treatments at 2 years. However, reduction at 2 years was greater with hydrochlorothiazide than with captopril or prazosin. CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive drugs differ in their effects on left atrial size. Hydrochlorothiazide was associated with greater overall reduction of left atrial size than other drugs effective for the treatment of hypertension. Reduction of left atrial size with therapy is in part independent of factors known to influence left atrial size, including LV mass and reduction of LV mass with treatment. The clinical benefit of reducing left atrial size with antihypertensive treatment remains to be determined.","Aged, Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, *Echocardiography, Heart Atria/drug effects, Humans, Hypertension/*drug therapy/*ultrasonography, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Middle Aged",-1

Epub 2003 Oct 30.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid intervention by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or endovascular treatment may cause hemodynamic change. The immediate and long-term effects on blood pressure after these procedures were assessed. METHODS: Patients were randomized to CEA (n=49) or endovascular treatment (n=55) that comprised percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone (n=31), balloon-expandable stent (n=13), or self-expandable stent (n=11). A baseline 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording was made before carotid intervention and repeated at 24 hours, 1 month, and 6 months after the procedure. RESULTS: In the first 24 hours after the procedure, episodes of hypotension occurred in 75% of the CEA group and 76% of the endovascular group; hypertension occurred in 11% and 13%, respectively. There was a significant fall in blood pressure at 1 hour after the procedure in both groups (24 and 16 mm Hg fall in CEA and endovascular groups, respectively), but this was only sustained in the endovascular group. The pattern of blood pressure response in the first 24 hours was significantly different (P<0.0001, ANCOVA). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower at 1 and 6 months only in the surgical group (6 and 5 mm Hg fall, respectively).

7912347,Cladribine in treatment of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.,"Sipe JC, Romine JS, Koziol JA, McMillan R, Zyroff J, Beutler E",Lancet. 1994 Jul 2;344(8914):9-13.,"Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is a severely disabling demyelinating disease in which autoimmune processes seem to have a major role. The nucleoside drug cladribine is a potent lympholytic agent with few side-effects. We have studied its efficacy and safety in a randomised double-blind trial. 51 patients (48 entered as matched pairs) received four monthly courses of 0.7 mg/kg cladribine or placebo (saline) given through a surgically implanted central line. Neurologists with no knowledge of which medication the patient was receiving examined the patients monthly and noted two rating scale scores (Kurtzke and Scripps). Cerebrospinal fluid and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were done at 6 and 12 months. Average neurological scores, demyelinated volumes on MRI, and concentrations of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid were stable or improved in the patients receiving cladrabine but continued to deteriorate in patients on placebo. Mean paired (placebo minus matched cladribine) differences at 12 months relative to baseline were 1.0 (SE 0.4) for the Kurtzke scores, -13.9 (2.3) for the Scripps scores, 4.57 (1.17) mL for demyelinated volumes, and 7.3 (3.3) arbitrary units for concentrations of oligoclonal bands. Cladribine was generally well tolerated and clinically significant toxicity occurred in only 1 patient, in whom severe marrow suppression developed with complete recovery after several months. 1 patient died of newly acquired hepatitis B, an event unlikely to be related to cladribine. We conclude that the immunosuppressive drug cladribine influences favourably the course of chronic progressive MS.","Adult, Brain/pathology, Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins/analysis, Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/cerebrospinal fluid/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Neurologic Examination",-1
11465868,Antiepileptogenic agents: how close are we?,"Temkin NR, Jarell AD, Anderson GD",Drugs. 2001;61(8):1045-55.,"Epilepsy is a common neurological condition, affecting about 4% of individuals over their lifetime. Epilepsy can be idiopathic, secondary to an underlying genetic abnormality or unknown causes, or acquired. Known potential causes account for about one third of epilepsy. Control of epilepsy has primarily focused on suppressing seizure activity after epilepsy has developed. An intriguing possibility is to control acquired epilepsy by preventing epileptogenesis, the process by which the brain becomes epileptic. Many laboratory models simulate human epilepsy as well as provide a system for studying epileptogenesis. The kindling model involves repeated application of subconvulsive electrical stimulation to the brain, leading to spontaneous seizures. Other models include the cortical or systemic injection of various chemicals. These models suggest that many antiepileptic drugs, from phenobarbital and valproate (valproic acid) to levetiracetam and tiagabine, have antiepileptogenic potential. Some promising other possibilities include N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) antagonists as well as the neurotrophins and their receptors. Phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, carbamazepine and, to a very limited extent, diazepam have been evaluated in clinical trials to test whether they actually prevent epileptogenesis in humans. Results have been very disappointing. Meta-analyses of 12 different drug-condition combinations show none with significantly lower unprovoked seizure rates among those receiving the active drug. In 4 of the 12, the observed rate was actually slightly higher among treated individuals. None of the newer drugs have been evaluated in antiepileptogenesis trials. Until some drugs demonstrate a clear antiepileptogenic effect in clinical trials, the best course to reduce the incidence of epilepsy is primary prevention of the risk-increasing events--for example, wearing helmets, using seat belts, or decreasing the risk of stroke by reducing smoking.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/*pharmacology, Clinical Trials as Topic, Craniocerebral Trauma/complications/prevention & control, Disease Models, Animal, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/*physiopathology, Humans, Risk Factors, Seizures/*physiopathology/*prevention & control, Smoking/adverse effects, Stroke/complications/prevention & control",-1
11085199,Levetiracetam. A review of its adjunctive use in the management of partial onset seizures.,"Dooley M, Plosker GL",Drugs. 2000 Oct;60(4):871-93.,"Levetiracetam, the S-enantiomer of alpha-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrollidine acetamide, is approved for use as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with partial onset seizures. Oral levetiracetam 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day administered as adjunctive therapy for up to 18 weeks significantly increased responder rates and reduced seizure frequency compared with placebo in 3 well designed pivotal trials in adults with treatment-refractory partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. Levetiracetam 3000 mg/day also significantly increased the number of seizure-free patients, but the effects of levetiracetam 1000 and 2000 mg/day on this end-point were unclear. Effects on seizure severity were not assessed in these trials. Although not yet approved as monotherapy or for use in paediatric patients, efficacy was observed with levetiracetam 3000 mg/day as monotherapy in adult patients with refractory partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and with the 10 to 40 mg/kg/day dosage as adjunctive therapy in children with refractory partial seizures. However, these data are limited. Oral levetiracetam 1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day as adjunctive therapy is generally well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse events similar to that observed with placebo. The most commonly reported events in individual clinical trials were CNS-related and included somnolence, asthenia, headache and dizziness. Levetiracetam administered as adjunctive therapy does not appear to interact with other anticonvulsant drugs, and no clinically relevant interactions were observed between levetiracetam and digoxin, warfarin or probenecid; oral contraceptive protective efficacy was also not affected by levetiracetam. CONCLUSIONS: Levetiracetam is a new anticonvulsant agent with a favourable tolerability profile and a low potential for drug interactions. It has shown efficacy as adjunctive therapy in patients with treatment-refractory partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in clinical trials. Direct comparative trials with other anticonvulsant agents are not yet available, but placebo-controlled clinical evidence to date suggests that levetiracetam (1000, 2000 and 3000 mg/day) is a useful option as adjunctive therapy in patients with this subtype of epilepsy.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Animals, *Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Child, Cognition/drug effects, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Interactions, Drug Tolerance, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Kidney/metabolism, Models, Biological, Piracetam/*analogs &, derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Quality of Life, Seizures/*drug therapy, Tissue Distribution",-1

The progressive nature of the encephalopathy in our cases was documented by serial clinical examination, electroencephalograms, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic scans. The natural history of gliomatosis cerebri was determined by a retrospective review of the literature of 160 cases in 85 reports. The most common neurologic symptoms and signs included corticospinal tract deficits (58%), dementia/mental retardation (44%), headache (39%), seizures (38%), cranioneuropathies (37%), increased intracranial pressure (34%), and spinocerebellar deficits (33%).

Twenty-four male subjects with cervical SCI participated in this study; 14 were maintained on oral baclofen, and 10 served as age-matched controls. The subjects were challenged with increasing concentrations of aerosolized histamine until either a 20% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) from baseline (defined as PC20) was observed, or a maximum of 25 mg/ml histamine was administered. We found that 11 of the 14 baclofen subjects (78.5%) and 8 of the 10 control subjects (80%) responded (PC20 < 8 mg/ml) to the histamine challenge. Mean PC20 values among responders in the baclofen (PC20 = 2.91 +/- 2.3) and control (PC20 = 2.18 +/- 1.9) groups did not differ significantly. Because histamine acts directly on histamine receptors and indirectly on cholinergic pathways, our findings that baclofen blocks bronchoconstriction due to inhaled methacholine, but not that due to histamine, suggests that hyperresponsiveness in subjects with cervical SCI may be secondary to nonspecific airway hyperreactivity.","Adult, Aerosols, Baclofen/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Bronchial Hyperreactivity/*physiopathology, Bronchial Provocation Tests, Bronchoconstriction/drug effects/physiology, Case-Control Studies, GABA Agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Histamine/*diagnostic use, Humans, Male, Spinal Cord Injuries/*physiopathology",-1
7917080,Newer antiepileptic drugs. Towards an improved risk-benefit ratio.,"Patsalos PN, Sander JW",Drug Saf. 1994 Jul;11(1):37-67.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Even though existing antiepileptic drugs can render 80% of newly diagnosed patients seizure free, a significant number of patients have chronic intractable epilepsy causing disability with considerable socioeconomic implications. There is, therefore, a need for more potent and effective antiepileptic drugs and drugs with fewer adverse effects, particularly CNS effects. Drugs for the treatment of partial seizures are particularly needed. With major advances in our understanding of the basic neuropathology, neuropharmacology and neurophysiology of epilepsy, numerous candidate novel antiepileptic drugs have been developed in recent years. This review comparatively evaluates the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and adverse effects of 12 new antiepileptic drugs namely vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, felbamate, tiagabine, eterobarb, zonisamide, remacemide, stiripentol, topiramate and levetiracetam (ucb-L059). Of the 12 drugs, vigabatrin, lamotrigine and gabapentin have recently been marketed in the UK. Five of these new drugs have known mechanisms of action (vigabatrin, lamotrigine, tiagabine, oxcarbazepine and eterobarb), which may provide for a more rational approach to the treatment of epilepsy. Oxcarbazepine, remacemide and eterobarb are prodrugs. Vigabatrin, gabapentin and topiramate are more promising on the basis of their pharmacokinetic characteristics in that they are excreted mainly unchanged in urine and not susceptible to significant pharmacokinetic interactions. In contrast, lamotrigine, felbamate and stiripentol exhibit significant drug interactions. Essentially, all the drugs are effective in partial or secondarily generalised seizures and are effective to varying degrees in other seizure types. Particularly welcome is the possible effectiveness of zonisamide in myoclonus and felbamate in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In relation to adverse effects, CNS effects are observed with all drugs, however, gabapentin, remacemide and levetiracetam appear to exhibit least. There is also the possibility of rational duotherapy, using drugs with known mechanisms of action, as an additional therapeutic approach. The efficacy of these 12 antiepileptic drug occurs despite the fact that candidate antiepileptic drugs are evaluated under highly unfavourable conditions, namely as add-on therapy in patients refractory to drug management and with high seizure frequency. Thus, whilst candidate drugs which do become licensed are an advance in that they are effective and/or are associated with less adverse effects than currently available antiepileptic drugs in these patients, it is possible that these drugs may exhibit even more improved risk-benefit ratios when used in normal clinical practice.","Acetamides/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Acetates/adverse effects/therapeutic use, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Carbamazepine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dioxolanes/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Epilepsy/drug therapy, Fructose/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Humans, Isoxazoles/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Nipecotic Acids/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Phenobarbital/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Phenylcarbamates, Piracetam/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Propylene Glycols/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Risk Factors, Triazines/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Vigabatrin, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use",-1

DESIGN: Randomized controlled clinical trial of physician-targeted interventions. SETTING: Academic primary care group practice caring for an urban, medically indigent patient population. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 60 and older who exceeded the threshold on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and their primary care physicians. INTERVENTION: Physicians of intervention patients were provided with patient-specific treatment recommendations during 3 special visits scheduled specifically to address the patient's symptoms of depression. In general, physicians were encouraged to establish a diagnosis of depression and educate their patient about the diagnosis, discontinue medications that can cause or exacerbate depressive symptoms, initiate antidepressants when appropriate, and consider referral to psychiatry. Guidelines for prescribing antidepressants were provided. Control physicians received no intervention, and control patients received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of recording a depression diagnosis, stopping medications associated with depression, initiating antidepressant medication, and psychiatry referral; mean changes in HAM-D and Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) scores. RESULTS: One hundred three physicians and 175 patients were involved in the clinical trial. Physicians of intervention patients were more likely to diagnose depression and prescribe antidepressants (P < 0.01). There were no differences between the groups in the frequency of stopping medications associated with depression or referrals to psychiatry. Medications with the strongest cause and effect relationship to depression were infrequently used in this cohort of patients. Although both groups showed improvement in HAM-D and SIP scores, we were unable to demonstrate significant differences in HAM-D or SIP scores between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive screening and feedback of patient-specific treatment recommendations increased the recognition and treatment of late life depression by primary care physicians. However, we were unable to demonstrate significant improvement in depression or disability severity among intervention patients despite the informational support provided to their physicians. Efforts to improve the functional status of these patients may require more integrated interventions and more aggressive attempts to target psychosocial stressors traditionally outside the purview of primary care.","Aged, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depressive Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology, Education, Medical, Continuing, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Primary Health Care, Prognosis, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychiatry, Referral and Consultation",-1
9530548,Tiagabine. A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential in the management of epilepsy.,"Adkins JC, Noble S",Drugs. 1998 Mar;55(3):437-60.,"Tiagabine is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake inhibitor which is structurally related to nipecotic acid but has an improved ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Clinical trials have shown that tiagabine is effective as add-on therapy in the management of patients with refractory partial epilepsy. In short term studies of this indication, tiagabine < or = 64 mg/day for 7 to 12 weeks reduced the complex partial and simple partial seizure frequency by > or = 50% in 8 to 31 and 28.2 to 37% of patients, respectively. Tiagabine appeared to produce a sustained reduction in seizure frequency in studies of up to 12 months' duration. Data from preliminary studies are currently insufficient to confirm the usefulness of tiagabine when used as monotherapy or in the treatment of children with epilepsy. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to more fully elucidate the efficacy of the drug in these settings. Adverse events associated with tiagabine are primarily CNS-related and include dizziness, asthenia, nonspecific nervousness and tremor. Skin rash or psychosis occurred with similar frequencies among tiagabine- and placebo-treated patients. With long term administration (> or = 1 year for many patients), the profile and incidence of adverse events was similar to that for short term therapy. Tiagabine does not appear to affect the hepatic metabolism of other drugs such as carbamazepine and phenytoin. Possible disadvantages of tiagabine include its short plasma elimination half-life, necessitating 2 to 4 times daily administration, and its inducible hepatic metabolism. Thus, tiagabine is a new antiepileptic agent with a novel mechanism of action, which has demonstrated efficacy in the adjunctive treatment of patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Further investigation of the efficacy of tiagabine is expected to provide a clearer definition of its place in the treatment of epilepsy and its relative merits in relation to other antiepileptic drugs.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/metabolism, Humans, Mice, Neurotransmitter Uptake Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Nipecotic Acids/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use",-1

8882535,Eclampsia--are we doing enough?,"Low JJ, Yeo GS",Singapore Med J. 1995 Oct;36(5):505-9.,"OBJECTIVES: This paper reviews the cases of eclampsia managed at the Kandang Kerbau Hospital with respect to incidence, management, maternal and perinatal outcome. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of eclampsia occurring over a 4-year period from January 1990 to December 1993. RESULTS: There were 27 cases of eclampsia among 59,599 deliveries during the study period, giving an overall incidence of 45.3 per 100,000 deliveries. Sixteen patients were nulliparous and the mean age was 29 years. Two-thirds of the cohort were booked patients and more than half of the cohort (55.6%) had their first seizure despite being in hospital. The majority (86.2%) of all seizures recorded occurred in the antepartum and intrapartum period. Eleven of the patients (40.7%) were asymptomatic prior to the first fit while headache was the commonest symptom of impending eclampsia in the remainder. Fifteen patients (55.6%) had significant proteinuria and this was associated with significant neonatal morbidity. The mean gestational age was 35.9 weeks and the mean birth weight was 2,328g. Major areas of substandard management included failure to administer anticonvulsant prophylaxis and antihypertensive agents when indicated, failure to assess for proteinuria, and failure to closely monitor the hypertensive and proteinuric patient. Seven patients developed convulsions despite anticonvulsant prophylaxis. Twenty-four patients were delivered by Caesarean section. There were 26 live born infants (singletons) and one abortus. There was no perinatal mortality. Neonatal morbidity was frequent and attributable to prematurity (51.9%) and birth asphyxia (29.6%). The majority of infants were well neurologically on long term follow-up. There was no maternal mortality but significant morbidity was present in 8 patients (29.6%). High uric acid levels were associated with intrauterine death, prematurity and intrauterine growth retardation. Seven patients remained hypertensive on follow-up. Residual neurological deficits persisted in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of eclampsia at Kandang Kerbau Hospital shows an unsteady decline over the past 4 years. It carries significant foetal mortality (3.7%) as well as neonatal (74.1%) and maternal (29.6%) morbidity. The observation that neither the occurrence of antenatal office visits nor hospitalisation prevents eclampsia, and that substandard management was identified in most of the cases (77.8%) shows that there is no room for complacency and that more needs to be done. Improvement in patient assessment, institution of appropriate preventive therapy, a high index of suspicion even in apparently low-risk patients coupled with a disease notification system and regular audit may be the key strategies to reduce the incidence of this dreaded obstetric complication.","Adult, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Diazepam/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, *Eclampsia/epidemiology/physiopathology/prevention & control/therapy, Female, Humans, Incidence, Infant, Newborn, Infant, Newborn, Diseases/epidemiology/*physiopathology, Pregnancy, *Pregnancy Complications/physiopathology, Pregnancy Outcome, Prognosis, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Seizures/drug therapy/physiopathology/*prevention & control, Singapore/epidemiology",-1

METHODS: Baclofen was administered orally in 14 and intrathecally in 8 patients. H(max)/M(max), presynaptic inhibition by biceps femoris tendon tap of femoral nerve stimulation, depression of the soleus H-reflex following previous activation of the Ia afferents from the soleus muscle (i.e. postactivation depression), disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition of the soleus H-reflex and the number of backpropagating action potentials in primary afferents, which may be a sign of presynaptic inhibition, were examined. RESULTS: Baclofen depressed the soleus H(max)/M(max) ratio significantly following oral and intrathecal baclofen. None of the two tests of presynaptic inhibition, or the postactivation depression or the disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition of the soleus H-reflex were affected by baclofen administration. Also the action potentials of the primary afferents were unchanged during baclofen administration. CONCLUSIONS: The antispastic effect of baclofen is not caused by an effect on the transmitter release from Ia afferents or on disynaptic reciprocal Ia inhibition. One possible explanation of the depression of the H-reflex by baclofen is suggested to be a direct depression of motoneuronal excitability.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Electric Stimulation, Electromyography, Female, H-Reflex/drug effects/physiology, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/*physiopathology, Neural Pathways/*drug effects/*physiopathology, Spasm/*drug therapy/*physiopathology, Spinal Cord/*drug effects/*physiopathology",-1

All of the patients treated had a history of headaches of many years' standing and many of them had failed attempts at treatment. In the amitriptyline group, a significant reduction in daily headache duration was already found in the 3rd week of treatment, while in the placebo group no significant changes in headache duration were to be seen. In week 6 the amitriptyline group had a significantly shorter daily duration of headache than did the placebo group. Treatment did not result in any significant effects on EMG recordings of pericranial muscle activity either during relaxation or contraction, on exteroceptive suppression of the temporal muscle and on CNV. The sensitivity to suprathreshold experimental pain, however, was significantly reduced. The data show a statistically relevant reduction of daily headache duration. However, they also show that amitriptyline can only partly alleviate chronic headaches but cannot cure them.","Adult, Amitriptyline/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Contingent Negative Variation/drug effects, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography/drug effects, Electromyography, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle, Skeletal/*physiopathology, Pain Measurement/*drug effects, Tension-Type Headache/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the electroclinical features and evolution in patients with benign familial and non-familial infantile seizures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients (36 males and 28 females) were evaluated at the Neurology Department of the J. P. Garrahan Children's Hospital between February 1990 and December 2001. We analyzed gender, age at onset, duration, manifestations, circadian distribution and frequency of seizures, family history of epilepsy and paroxysmal dyskinesias. EEG and neuroradiological studies were performed. The semeiology of the seizures was analyzed only according to the description in the clinical history. Ictal EEGs could not be recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients, 14 girls and 11 boys, had a family history of similar seizures with an age at seizure onset of 3 to 22 months (median of 5.5 months). Nine patients (36%) had apparently generalized convulsions only; five patients (20%) partial seizures only and ten patients (50%) had both partial and generalized seizures. Convulsions were brief, during wakefulness in all, and occurred in clusters in 12 patients (48%). Interictal EEG was normal in 24 patients (96%). Similar seizures and age at onset were found in 14 fathers, ten mothers and one uncle of these patients. Twenty-two patients (88%) had their last seizure before the age of 30 months. Two siblings of the same family later had brief episodes of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, which in one of them were associated with infantile seizures. Later, two fathers developed paroxysmal kinesigenic dystonia. One of them also had had infantile seizures. A second group of 39 patients (25 boys and 14 girls) showed similar electroclinical features and evolution but there was no history of infantile seizures in first-degree relatives family history of epilepsy was found in 12.8% of second-degree relatives, but the type of epilepsy could not be defined. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the existence of a familial benign epileptic syndrome in infancy, of probable dominant autosomical transmission. A large group also had similar electroclinical features but without a family history. We discuss the possible relationships between the two groups and suggest that further genetic studies may solve the problem.","Age of Onset, Chorea/complications/genetics, Circadian Rhythm/physiology, Disease Progression, Electroencephalography, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Genes, Dominant/genetics, Humans, Infant, Male, Seizures/diagnosis/*genetics/*physiopathology, Sleep/physiology, Wakefulness/physiology",-1

The clinical examination was normal, except for sequelae of hand and feet surgery during infancy for post-axial polydactyly. Cerebral MRI showed a hypothalamic hamartoma. The association of complex limb abnormalities with hypothalamic hamartoma lead to the diagnosis of Pallister-Hall syndrome. This syndrome is related to a mutation of gene GLI3, located on chromosome 7p13, and its inheritance is autosomal dominant. In the case of laughing seizures, a cerebral MRI should be performed to look for a hypothalamic hamartoma. The observation of such lesions indicates the necessity of standard radiographies of the hands and feet, to search for associated abnormalities. These findings might help to recognize a Pallister-Hall syndrome, thus allowing genetic counseling.","Adult, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics, Epilepsy/diagnosis/genetics/*physiopathology, Female, Hamartoma/*physiopathology, Humans, Hypothalamic Diseases/diagnosis/genetics/*physiopathology, Limb Deformities, Congenital/complications/radiography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Pedigree, Syndrome",-1

Fifteen serum samples each were collected from 6 able-bodied volunteers and 13 patients with SCI (7 paraplegics, 6 quadriplegics) in a prospective, open-label, pharmacokinetic study of a single 100-mg oral dose of dantrolene. After a washout period, a single 10-mg intravenous dose of metoclopramide was given along with dantrolene to the patients with SCI only, and the study was repeated in sequential, crossover fashion. Concentrations of dantrolene were measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Numerical integration was used to calculate area under the curve (AUC) and mean residence time (MRT). Differences were studied using paired and two-sample, nonparametric tests, with 0.05 as the significance level. Without metoclopramide, the AUC of dantrolene was larger in able-bodied volunteers than in patients with SCI, and the MRT of dantrolene was similar both groups. When patients with SCI received metoclopramide before treatment with dantrolene, the median increase in the AUC for dantrolene was 57%, with no change in MRT. This pharmacokinetic interaction is probably attributable to augmented absorption and could alter the pharmacologic action of dantrolene. Concurrent treatment of patients with SCI with metoclopramide and dantrolene should be accompanied by careful surveillance to avoid toxicity and preserve efficacy.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Biological Availability, Cross-Over Studies, Dantrolene/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Dopamine Antagonists/*pharmacology, Drug Interactions, Humans, Injections, Intravenous, Male, Metoclopramide/*pharmacology, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Paraplegia/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism, Prospective Studies, Quadriplegia/drug therapy/etiology/metabolism, Reference Values, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/*drug therapy/*metabolism",-1

The involuntary cramps caused a dystonic posture of the neck and limbs. Opisthotonos was noted when the cramps were exacerbated. The cramps were painful and sensitive to movement, so the patient limited movement of his body. External stimulation, such as a pin prick or a loud noise, would aggravate them. The contractions of the muscles persisted during sleep. No other neurologic abnormalities were noted. Electromyography showed spontaneous continuous muscle fiber activity. The symptoms did not respond to baclofen or diazepam; however, remarkable improvement was noted after giving phenytoin. The clinical presentation, electromyographic findings, and the patient's beneficial response to phenytoin fulfilled the diagnostic characteristics of Isaacs syndrome.","Adolescent, Electromyography, Humans, Male, Muscle Contraction, Muscle Cramp/drug therapy, Muscle Rigidity/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Neuromuscular Diseases/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Phenytoin/*therapeutic use, Syndrome",-1

Effective primary and secondary prevention strategies include therapies to lower LDL and total cholesterol and to increase HDL. Further, it seems that there is a need for therapeutic reduction in triglycerides as it emerges as an independent risk factor for CVD. Many clinical trials have been designed to evaluate pharmacologic compounds in the treatment of the dyslipidemias and they seem to have shown a safe profile, both in the experiment phases and in post-marketing observation studies. Nevertheless, sporadic reports of hepatotoxicity with statins and niacin still arise (Table 2). Although routine hepatic biochemical test monitoring is recommended, the cost-effectiveness is questionable because often these reactions are idiosyncratic and may not be identified by this routine screening. The risk/benefit ratio is in favor of using these medications in individuals at risk. There is no evidence to suggest intrinsic hepatotoxic activity as such. Drugs that lower triglycerides such as fibrates, have been observed to improve hepatic biochemical tests, although in small series. This leads to speculation whether treatment with fibrates would be beneficial for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that is emerging as one of enormous magnitude.","Anticholesteremic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Cardiovascular Diseases/prevention & control, Drug-Induced Liver Injury/*etiology, Female, Fish Oils/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Humans, Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Hypercholesterolemia/drug therapy, Male, Niacin/adverse effects/therapeutic use",-1

Notable developments have occurred in pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and health-care delivery. A better understanding of the biologic basis for addiction has led to clinical trials of medications that target neuroreceptors. One such medication is the opiate antagonist naltrexone, which decreases the craving for alcohol. Psychosocial interventions continue to be the mainstay of alcohol treatment programs. The efficacy of three different therapies was demonstrated in a study called Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity). This study, however, did not prove the patient-treatment ""matching"" hypothesis. In addition to therapies provided by addiction specialists, interest is growing in the use of brief motivational techniques in primary-care settings. As the field of addiction responds to an unfolding health-care delivery system, a broader range of treatment options in conjunction with a greater opportunity to individualize patient care is evolving.","Alcohol Deterrents/therapeutic use, Alcoholism/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy, Anti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use, Benzodiazepines, Continuity of Patient Care, Disulfiram/therapeutic use, Humans, Naltrexone/therapeutic use, Narcotic Antagonists/therapeutic use, Psychotherapy/*methods",-1

Severe restlessness can be a barrier in the multidisciplinary treatment of patients with TBI. The following case describes a patient with restlessness after a head-on motor vehicle accident. The patient was tachycardic, diaphoretic, demonstrating decerebrate posturing and a Rancho Los Amigos Stage II--III. Significant left lower leg restlessness was severe enough to cause bruising and ulceration. A multidisciplinary look was taken at the effects of using different neurotransmitter modulators in the treatment of restlessness after a TBI. Current biology treatment options include the use of medications that either modulate dopamine or noradrenaline alone. Bupropion effects both the dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways. In the following case, the patient's restlessness was resistant to almost every medication employed. The only medication that proved to be effective in significantly reducing the patient's restlessness was bupropion. The evidence for the use of bupropion in the treatment of restlessness after a TBI has never been discussed previously, aside from anecdotal accounts. It is hoped that this case will prove insight into another treatment option for patients who have severe restlessness.","Adult, Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Bupropion/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Female, Head Injuries, Closed/*complications, Humans, Psychomotor Agitation/*drug therapy/etiology, Treatment Outcome",-1

METHODS: A 33-year-old man with AIDS-related PML developed very severe spastic paraparesis (Ashworth rigidity score, 4) and painful muscle spasms. The patient was unable to sit in his wheelchair and remained bed bound. Combined oral baclofen and tizanidine at therapeutical doses were used without any effect on the spasticity. The patient refused the placement of an intrathecal catheter for long-term baclofen infusion. A single intrathecal ethanol (6 ml) injection in the L2-L3 intervertebral space with the patient placed in a lateral Trendelenburg (40 C) position was performed. RESULTS: The procedure was very effective in improving the stiffness (Ashworth rigidity score. 2, after the technique) and the muscle spasms disappeared. No side effects during or after the injection were observed. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal ethanol block is a last but very useful choice for treatment of intractable spasticity in PML and other neurologic disorders in AIDS patients when other oral treatments have failed and intrathecal baclofen infusion is not suitable.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications, Adult, Ethanol/*therapeutic use, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*complications, Male, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology",-1

This study examines the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of talampanel in patients with intractable epilepsy and assesses the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction. METHODS: Eleven of 14 patients entered into the study completed. Fourteen patients were evaluated for safety, 13 patients were used in the single-dose, and 11 patients in the multiple-dose pharmacokinetic analysis. Each patient initially received a single 35-mg dose of talampanel followed by the measurement of pharmacokinetic profiles. A 21-day t.i.d. dosing regimen was then determined for each patient based on his or her initial pharmacokinetic profile. Adverse events were recorded by patients or their carers. RESULTS: After oral ingestion, talampanel was rapidly absorbed, with maximal plasma concentrations achieved within 1-3 h. Talampanel concentrations in patients taking enzyme-inducing AEDs were 50% lower than those seen in healthy volunteers. Mean talampanel t1/2 values were 3.0 h compared with 4.2 h in healthy volunteers. After multiple-dose and steady-state, talampanel t1/2 values were increased to 5.6 h Talampanel and valproic acid (VPA) appear to inhibit each other's metabolism mutually. Talampanel had no effect on plasma concentrations of other AEDs. Multiple-dose talampanel administration was associated with nonlinear pharmacokinetics. No serious adverse events were reported; the most frequently reported being dizziness, ataxia, drowsiness, and headaches CONCLUSIONS: Talampanel dosing strategies may be reliant on concomitant AED medication, as enzyme-inducing AEDs enhance, whereas VPA inhibits its metabolism. Talampanel was well tolerated, although adverse events occurred at lower doses compared with those in healthy subjects, probably because of the additive effect of concomitant AEDs.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics, Area Under Curve, Benzodiazepines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics, Biological Availability, Chronic Disease, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Interactions, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsy/*blood/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged",-1

At one time or another 113 patients (51 men, 62 women; age range, 37-88 years) had been on opioid therapy either alone (36 patients) or with opioids added secondarily to other medications used to treat RLS (77 patients). Twenty-three of the 36 opioid monotherapy patients had failed dopaminergic and other therapeutic agents prior to the initiation of opioid monotherapy. Twenty of the 36 opioid monotherapy patients continue on monotherapy for an average of 5 years 11 months (range, 1-23 years), despite their knowledge of the availability of other therapies. Of the 16 patients who discontinued opioids as a sole therapy, the medication was discontinued in only one case because of problems related to addiction and tolerance. Polysomnography on seven patients performed after an average of 7 years 1 month of opioid monotherapy (range, 1-15 years) showed a tendency toward an improvement in all leg parameters and associated arousals (decrease in PLMS index, PLMS arousal index, and PLM while awake index) as well as all sleep parameters (increase in stages 3 and 4 and REM sleep, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and decrease in sleep latency). Two of these seven patients developed sleep apnea and a third patient had worsening of preexisting apnea. Opioids seem to have long-term effectiveness in the treatment of RLS and PLMS, but patients on long-term opioid therapy should be clinically or polysomnographically monitored periodically for the development of sleep apnea.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Germany, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Narcotics/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Opioid-Related Disorders, Patient Compliance, Polysomnography, Restless Legs Syndrome/*drug therapy, Retrospective Studies, Sleep Apnea Syndromes/*chemically induced, Treatment Outcome, United States",-1

Esomeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), is the S-isomer of omeprazole. Esomeprazole has FDA-approved labeling for use in the treatment of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), including healing and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and as part of a triple-drug regimen for Helicobocter pylori infection. Esomeprazole is structurally similar to other PPIs but is the first PPI to include only the active isomer, which may lead to improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics. Esomeprazole maintains intragastric pH at a higher level and above 4 for a longer period than other PPIs. Clinical studies have shown that esomeprazole is at least equivalent in safety and efficacy to other drugs in the class. Esomeprazole has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of erosive esophagitis, the maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis, and the treatment of signs and symptoms of GERD. Effective dosages are 20 or 40 mg orally every day or as needed. Esomeprazole magnesium 40 mg once daily in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin is effective in eradicating H. pylori infection. The potential for interacting with other drugs is limited and is similar to that of omeprazole. The most common adverse effects are headache, respiratory infection, and abdominal symptoms.

METHODS: AUS-STEPS was an open-label, multicenter, prospective study in patients experiencing partial seizures who were inadequately controlled with one to three concurrent antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). GBP treatment was titrated to a maximum of 4,800 mg/day, over a treatment period of 24 weeks, to achieve an efficacious and tolerable dosage. Efficacy was assessed by seizure-frequency data. Quality of life was evaluated by using the QOLIE-10 questionnaire, and safety was assessed by adverse-event reports and clinical laboratory findings. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients received treatment with GBP, with 174 evaluable for intention-to-treat (ITT) efficacy analysis. A reduction of >50% in overall seizure frequency was observed in 93 patients (53%). There was a small (4.6%) overall improvement in QOLIE-10 score. The most frequent adverse events were dizziness (31%), fatigue (29%), somnolence (27%), headache (21%), and ataxia (20%), with no major increase seen in adverse events necessitating discontinuation as the dose of GBP was titrated upward.

12633129,Lamotrigine in patients with bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence.,"Brown ES, Nejtek VA, Perantie DC, Orsulak PJ, Bobadilla L",J Clin Psychiatry. 2003 Feb;64(2):197-201.,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder is associated with the highest substance abuse rates of any psychiatric illness. Therefore, treatments that stabilize mood and decrease drug use or cravings are of great interest. Open-label lamotrigine was examined in 30 outpatients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder and cocaine dependence. Lamotrigine was either added to existing medication regimens or used as monotherapy. METHOD: Lamotrigine was started at a dose of 25 mg/day (12.5 mg/day in those taking valproic acid) and titrated to a maximum dose of 300 mg/day. Subjects received a baseline evaluation including a structured clinical interview and weekly assessments for 12 weeks with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Cocaine Craving Questionnaire (CCQ). At each appointment, a urine sample was obtained, and participants reported drug use during the previous week. The subjects consisted of 13 men and 17 women with cocaine dependence and bipolar I disorder (N = 22), bipolar II disorder (N = 7), or bipolar disorder not otherwise specified (N = 1), with a mean +/- SD age of 35.4 +/- 7.2 years. Data were analyzed using the last observation carried forward on all subjects who completed the baseline evaluation and at least 1 postbaseline assessment. RESULTS: Significant improvement was observed in HAM-D, YMRS, and BPRS scores (p < or =.02). Cravings also significantly decreased as measured by the CCQ (p <.001). Dollar amount spent on drugs decreased nonsignificantly. Lamotrigine was well tolerated, with no subjects discontinuing due to side effects. CONCLUSION: Lamotrigine treatment was well tolerated in this sample and associated with statistically significant improvement in mood and drug cravings but not drug use. The findings suggest that larger controlled trials of lamotrigine are needed in this population.","Adult, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Behavior, Addictive/diagnosis/drug therapy/psychology, Bipolar Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Cocaine-Related Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Pilot Projects, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Psychotropic Drugs/therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome, Triazines/*therapeutic use",-1

Difficulties accepting the diagnosis are frequently compounded by its unpredictable nature. Those affected commonly lose confidence and independence. Seizures in older people can result in physical injury, adding to low morale. Complete control is achievable in around 70% of patients with antiepileptic drug treatment. Optimum management requires rapid investigation, accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, sympathetic education, and assured support. The emergence of seizure disorders in old age places an increasing burden on health-care facilities and costs.

There has been an explosive use of new drugs in both psychiatry and cardiology without widespread knowledge of their potential interactions. The increasing tendency toward poly-pharmacy, the use of psychotropic medications by cardiologists and primary care physicians caring for cardiac patients, and the growth of the aging population present major challenges for the practitioner. Finally, there is a need to have models/paradigms for predicting potential drug interactions--e.g., the Cytochrome p450 schema. This paper describes a method to identify, understand, and codify the interactions between psychotropic and cardiac drugs, a systematic approach for updating this key database and specific cardiac-psychotropic drug interactions. Specifically, this paper 1) details the interactions, 2) addresses the level of their clinical significance, 3) describes the potential mechanism(s) of the interactions, and 4) offers recommendations to the clinician. Since the majority of the original clinical trials, either for cardiac medications or psychotropic drugs, do not include studies comparing these two drug domains contemporaneously, their interactions often become known only with their combined use in the clinical arena, using the patient as ""guinea pig,"" and through subsequent reporting.","Cardiovascular Agents/*pharmacology, Databases as Topic, Drug Interactions, Food-Drug Interactions, Guidelines as Topic, Humans, Internet, Psychotropic Drugs/*pharmacology",-1

Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) has been shown to produce periampullary sphincter relaxation. The aim of this study was to determine whether prophylactic long-acting GTN could reduce the incidence of ERCP-induced pancreatitis. METHODS: In a randomized double-blind study, prophylactic treatment with GTN (2 mg given sublingually 5 min before endoscopy) was compared with placebo in 186 patients who presented for elective ERCP. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of pancreatitis within 24 h, defined as a serum amylase concentration greater than 1000 units/ml in association with a visual analogue pain score of more than 5. RESULTS: The incidence of pancreatitis was lower in the GTN group compared with placebo (seven of 90 versus 17 of 96; P < 0.05). Mean serum amylase values were similar in the two groups. The protective effect of GTN appears to be highest in the diagnostic ERCP group (one of 54 versus ten of 66; P = 0.012) and in the group in which cholangiography alone was performed (one of 54 versus eight of 57; P = 0.032). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic treatment with GTN reduces the incidence of pancreatitis following ERCP but does not seem to reduce the extent of hyperamylasaemia or the severity of pancreatitis.","Acute Disease, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde/*adverse effects, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nitroglycerin/*therapeutic use, Pancreatitis/etiology/*prevention & control, Prospective Studies, Vasodilator Agents/*therapeutic use",-1

A total of 1,356 patients were evaluable for analysis. The majority of patients (81.1%) had at least three principal somatic complaints; asthenia being the most common, followed by dizziness and headache. Most patients (76.0%) were rated as moderately to extremely ill according to the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) severity score. All patients received oral sulpiride for 3-6 weeks (mean dose, 175 mg/day). Sulpiride demonstrated good efficacy as shown by a reduction in the incidence and severity of somatic complaints, and an improvement in CGI severity score and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist--58 items. Based on a CGI rating of very much or much improved, 58.2% of patients were rated as responders. Sulpiride was well tolerated. There were no serious adverse events and only 16 patients (1.2%) were withdrawn prematurely from the study due to adverse events. There were no differences between the countries regarding the patients' profile or their response to sulpiride. Thus, the prescription profile of sulpiride appears not to be culturally dependent.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cohort Studies, Dopamine Antagonists/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Safety, Somatoform Disorders/*drug therapy, Sulpiride/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",-1

Epub 2003 Jan 10.,"BACKGROUND: The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 gave states the option to withdraw Medicaid coverage of nonemergency care from most legal immigrants. Our goal was to assess the effect of PRWORA on hospital uncompensated care in the United States. METHODS: We collected the following state-level data for the period from 1994 through 1999: foreign-born, noncitizen population and health uninsurance rates (US Census Current Population Survey); percentage of teaching hospitals (American Hospital Association Annual Survey of Hospitals); and each state's decision whether to implement the PRWORA Medicaid bar for legal permanent residents or to continue offering nonemergency Medicaid coverage using state-only funds (Urban Institute). We modeled uncompensated care expenditures by state (also from the Annual Survey of Hospitals) in both univariate and multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: When measured at the state level, there was no significant relationship between uncompensated care expenditures and states' percentage of noncitizen immigrants. Uninsurance rates were the only significant factor in predicting uncompensated hospital care expenditures by state. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of uninsured patients would most surely reduce hospital expenditures for uncompensated care. However, data limitations hampered our efforts to obtain a monetary estimate of hospitals' financial losses due specifically to the immigrant eligibility changes in PRWORA. Quantifying the impact of these provisions on hospitals will require better data sources.","Eligibility Determination/legislation & jurisprudence/trends, Emigration and Immigration/*legislation & jurisprudence/statistics & numerical, data, Employment/*legislation & jurisprudence, Health Care Surveys, Hospital Costs/*statistics & numerical data, Humans, Medicaid/*legislation & jurisprudence, Medically Uninsured/statistics & numerical data, Poverty/statistics & numerical data, Social Welfare/*economics/*legislation & jurisprudence, State Health Plans/economics/*legislation & jurisprudence, Uncompensated Care/*statistics & numerical data, United States",-1

Although studied extensively in adults, there have been few pediatric studies. It is a unique drug because it has no protein binding, is not metabolized, and is excreted through the kidneys. There are no significant drug interactions with other antiepileptic drugs nor do other antiepileptic drugs alter the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin. The drug is effective in partial seizures, although most studies have used the drug as add-on therapy. It is approved for use of partial seizures with or without secondary generalization in patients over the age of 12 years. The side effect profile of the drug is quite good. No significant idiosyncratic reactions have been reported. The most common side effects have included dizziness, fatigue, and headache. Rarely, children will have adverse behavioral effects, such as hyperactivity and agitated behavior. Usually these children have pre-existing behavioral disturbances. Although the spectrum of efficacy of gabapentin remains to be determined, it is likely to have a major beneficial impact on the treatment of childhood epilepsy.","*Acetates/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, *Amines, Animals, *Anticonvulsants/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Disease Models, Animal, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/metabolism, Humans, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

11665869,A risk-benefit assessment of treatments for infantile spasms.,Nabbout R,Drug Saf. 2001;24(11):813-28.,"Infantile spasms are a devastating epileptic encephalopathy of the young child. The continuing spasms and hypsarrhythmia have a deleterious effect on brain maturation and further cognitive development. Corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or corticosteroids have been the gold standard treatment for the last 40 years, but there is little agreement on the best agent to use, or the dosage and duration of the treatment. Despite this empirical approach, corticotropin or corticosteroids are effective in controlling spasms and normalising electroencephalograms in about 60% of cases. The major concern with this treatment is the occurrence of frequent and severe adverse effects. The introduction of vigabatrin in the 1990s improved the outcome of infantile spasms. Vigabatrin shows an efficacy at least equal to that of corticosteroids, and even higher in specific groups such as those with tuberous sclerosis. The major advantages of vigabatrin are the ability to initiate treatment at the full dosage. rapid efficacy, suitability for outpatient treatment and particularly good tolerability with only minor adverse effects. Recently, however, the safety of vigabatrin has caused concern since a specific visual field loss has been reported in treated adults. The current problem is determining the risk-benefit ratio of vigabatrin and corticosteroids/corticotropin in children with infantile spasms, and to specify the groups where their use could be optimal. Visual field loss is usually asymptomatic and can be detected only by perimetric visual field studies. In children, especially in the young or disabled, it is difficult if not impossible to detect the visual field loss and it is not yet known if children are at higher or lower risk for this adverse effect. Until a clear answer about the occurrence of this adverse effect in children has been established through randomised study, vigabatrin may still be considered first-line therapy in infantile spasms. Children who do not achieve a good response to vigabatrin should be switched to corticotropin/corticosteroid therapy. Despite the efficacy of corticosteroids and vigabatrin, the use of the conventional antiepileptic drugs, the newly developed antiepileptic drugs and some promising results with ketogenic diet, 25 to 30% of patients with infantile spasms continue to have spasms and experience psychomotor regression. These drug-resistant patients could be candidates for surgery.","Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Epilepsy/drug therapy/surgery, Humans, Immunoglobulins/therapeutic use, Infant, Pyridoxine/therapeutic use, Risk Assessment, Spasms, Infantile/*drug therapy/surgery, Vigabatrin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Visual Fields/drug effects",-1

Accurate diagnosis and quantification of these disorders is essential for determining outcome, appropriate treatment, and criteria for inclusion in research trials. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent advances in diagnosis and treatment for childhood movement disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: The ultimate goal is to discover new treatments that can lead to measurable improvement in functional outcome for affected children. In order to accomplish this goal, we must have consistent definitions and accurate measurements to determine the diagnosis and severity for each child in a clinic or research trial. Recent progress in defining childhood movement disorders has led to consensus definitions of different types of hypertonia. There has also been progress in the development of outcome measures that relate to meaningful functional performance in a variety of skill areas. Most exciting is the prospect of new treatments, and we survey the current non-medical, medical, and surgical therapies for childhood motor disorders. SUMMARY: Although pediatric movement disorders are a complex and often poorly understood group of symptoms, recent work has shown that there is a possibility of defining, measuring, and ultimately treating these debilitating diseases.","Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Antiparkinson Agents/*therapeutic use, Child, Humans, *Movement Disorders/classification/drug therapy/physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/*physiopathology, Trihexyphenidyl/*therapeutic use",-1

DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials of anticonvulsants for acute, chronic, or cancer pain identified by using Medline, by hand searching, by searching reference lists, and by contacting investigators. SUBJECTS: Between 1966 and February 1994, 37 reports were found; 20 reports, of four anticonvulsants, were eligible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Numbers needed to treat were calculated for effectiveness, adverse effects, and drug related withdrawal from study. RESULTS: The only placebo controlled study in acute pain found no analgesic effect of sodium valproate. For treating trigeminal neuralgia, carbamazepine had a combined number needed to treat of 2.6 for effectiveness, 3.4 for adverse effects, and 24 for severe effects (withdrawal from study). For treating diabetic neuropathy, anticonvulsants had a combined number needed to treat of 2.5 for effectiveness, 3.1 for adverse effects, and 20 for severe effects. For migraine prophylaxis, anticonvulsants had a combined number needed to treat of 1.6 for effectiveness, 2.4 for adverse effects, and 39 for severe effects. Phenytoin had no effect on the irritable bowel syndrome, and carbamazepine had little effect on pain after stroke. Clonazepam was effective in one study for temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

General practitioners' perceptions of low back pain.,"Miller JS, Pinnington MA",Eur J Gen Pract. 2003 Mar;9(1):3-9.,"BACKGROUND: Low back pain is a common condition in general practice and represents a significant part of a general practitioner's workload. However, despite guidelines, back pain still presents considerable challenges to clinicians. OBJECTIVE: To explore the perceptions and declared behaviour of UK general practitioners in relation to patients with low back pain. METHOD: A qualitative design was used, involving semi-structured interviews with 17 GPs in the North of England. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. RESULTS: Two major themes emerged from the data relating to approaches to and perceptions of low back pain. A dichotomy emerged, where GPs describe their approach to what they know to be a straightforward consultation where most patients recover, and the frustration they experience when patients do not. Although GPs are using a simple bio-mechanistic approach to low back pain, they also operate a method of categorising patients, which involves identifying real and pseudo patients. When confronted with 'challenging' cases, that is those who do not recover, most GPs feel isolated and poorly prepared. CONCLUSION: GPs adopt a bio-mechanistic approach to LBP which appears to work well for the majority of patients, as the natural history of low back pain dictates that most patients will recover. However, this approach to low back pain fails at the margins and this is evident by the significant minority of persistent sufferers and the GP's reaction to them. Expanding patient-centredness to explore psychological and social dimensions in relation to low back pain presents an ongoing challenge in general practice.","Adult, Family Practice, Great Britain, Humans, Interviews as Topic, Low Back Pain/*therapy, Middle Aged",-1
11104201,Markedly severe dystonia in Japanese encephalitis.,"Kalita J, Misra UK",Mov Disord. 2000 Nov;15(6):1168-72.,"Encephalitis has been reported to be a rare cause of severe dystonia. We describe five patients with markedly severe dystonia from Japanese encephalitis. These patients with markedly severe dystonia were seen during the past 8 years as a subgroup of 50 patients with Japanese encephalitis. The diagnosis of markedly severe dystonia was based on increasingly frequent episodes of generalized dystonia with bulbar, respiratory, or metabolic derangement or leading to exhaustion or pain. The diagnosis of JE was based on clinicoradiologic features and a fourfold increase of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers in paired serum. The outcome of the patients was defined as a good, partial, or poor recovery on the basis of 1-year clinical status. All the patients were males, and their ages ranged from 6 to 19 years. Movement disorders appeared 1 to 3 weeks after the illness as the level of consciousness started improving. During the next 1 to 4 weeks, patients began to experience markedly severe dystonia. It was associated with marked axial dystonia resulting in opisthotonus and retrocollis in five patients, jaw-opening dystonia in two patients, teeth clenching in one patient, and oculogyric crisis and neck deviation in another patient. The attacks of markedly severe dystonia lasted for 2 to 30 minutes and occurred as many as 20 to 30 times daily. Other developments included fixed limb dystonia in one patient, severe spasticity and rigidity in five patients, and focal muscle wasting in one patient. These patients had only a modest improvement after treatment. Markedly severe dystonia abated by 2 to 6 months in all the patients who were followed up. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral thalamic involvement in all patients, brainstem involvement in three patients, and basal ganglia involvement in two patients. At the 3-month follow-up, all patients had a poor outcome. At 1 year, one patient had a complete recovery; one had a partial recovery; and two were bedridden. It can be concluded that markedly severe dystonia is an important and serious sequela of Japanese encephalitis and may occur as the result of thalamus, midbrain, or basal ganglia involvement in various combinations.","Adolescent, Adult, Basal Ganglia/pathology/virology, Child, Disease Progression, Dystonia/pathology/*virology, Encephalitis Virus, Japanese/*isolation & purification, Encephalitis, Japanese/*complications/pathology, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Mesencephalon/pathology/virology, Recovery of Function, Severity of Illness Index, Thalamus/*pathology/virology",-1

The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of TRI after spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric lidocaine 50 mg/ml diluted with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 1:1 and hyperbaric mepivacaine 40 mg/ml and hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg/ml. METHODS: Ninety ASA class I-IV patients undergoing mostly brief urological procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either hyperbaric lidocaine 50 mg/ml diluted with CSF 1:1 (Group L), hyperbaric mepivacaine 40 mg/ml (Group M) or hyperbaric bupivacaine 5 mg/ml (Group B). Characteristics of the patients and details of the surgical procedures and spinal anesthesias were similar in all groups except for the intensity of motor block. The patients were evaluated on the first postoperative day by an anesthesiologist who did not know which spinal anesthetic agent had been used. RESULTS: Six patients (20%) in group L, 11 patients (37%) in Group M and none (0%) in Group B experienced pain in the legs and/or back (TRI) after spinal anesthesia. CONCLUSION: TRI is frequent after spinal anesthesia induced with hyperbaric lidocaine 50 mg/ml diluted with CSF 1:1. The incidence of TRI after hyperbaric mepivacaine 40 mg/ml is of the same magnitude.

Pharmacological management of MS is primarily directed towards control of symptoms and prevention of disease progression or relapse. Although there are many drug and nondrug approaches used in the treatment of MS, this review focuses largely on approaches that incorporate some method of clinical outcome assessment. To aid in the interpretation of the data presented, a short descriptive summary of these assessment methods has been included. Although most studies incorporate at least one clinical outcome measure into the evaluation of efficacy, only one study has examined the economic impact of intervention in MS. The authors of that study demonstrated good correlation between the level of disability assessed using conventional quality-of-life measures and associated healthcare costs. Surprisingly, although many treatment approaches used in MS have significant associated toxicity and only modest benefits in terms of disease control, there is a remarkable paucity of data on the impact of these treatments on patients' quality of life.

8082355,Inhibition of bronchial hyperresponsiveness by the GABA-agonist baclofen.,"Dicpinigaitis PV, Spungen AM, Bauman WA, Absgarten A, Almenoff PL",Chest. 1994 Sep;106(3):758-61.,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a well-known inhibitory transmitter of the central nervous system. Recently, the presence of GABA and its receptors has been confirmed in peripheral tissues, including lung tissue. gamma-Aminobutyric acid and the GABA-agonist baclofen have been shown in animal studies to inhibit airway responsiveness to various bronchoconstricting agents. The results of these investigations suggest the possibility of a role for baclofen in the therapy of human airway hyperreactivity. We recently showed that subjects with cervical spinal cord injury (quadriplegia) uniformly exhibit hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. The interruption of sympathetic airway innervation and resultant unopposed cholinergic tone occurring after transection of the cervical spine are thought to explain this phenomenon. We compared bronchial responsiveness with methacholine (PC20) in a control group of otherwise healthy quadriplegic nonsmokers (n = 8) with a similar group of subjects (n = 6) maintained on baclofen for the relief of muscle spasm. Mean PC20 (mg/ml) among the control group was 1.42 +/- 1.6(SD) vs 15.0 +/- 9.1 in the baclofen group (p = 0.001). The inhibition of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury maintained on chronic baclofen therapy suggests the drug's ability to block neuronal acetylcholine release within airways, as well as a possible direct effect on airway smooth muscle. This action of baclofen, along with its documented ability in animal lung to inhibit release of other inflammatory mediators, supports further investigation of this drug as a potential therapeutic agent for asthma treatment.","Adult, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Bronchial Hyperreactivity/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology, Bronchial Provocation Tests, Drug Evaluation, Forced Expiratory Volume/drug effects, Humans, Male, Methacholine Chloride/diagnostic use, Middle Aged, Quadriplegia/complications/physiopathology, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/physiopathology, Vital Capacity/drug effects",-1

METHODS: Twelve children with spastic quadriparesis from varying causes had significant reductions in spasticity after a test dose of intrathecal baclofen and subsequently underwent placement of a programmable pump and intrathecal catheter tip placed at the T6-T7 level with fluoroscopic guidance. With the use of Ashworth scores for four muscle groups in both the upper and lower extremities, degrees of spasticity were determined by a physiatrist preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Mean changes in upper- and lower-extremity Ashworth scores and baclofen dosages for the entire cohort were compared with published results in which the catheter tip had been placed at the T11-T12 level. RESULTS: Spasticity was significantly reduced in all muscle groups (P < 0.001). The lower-extremity reduction in spasticity of 1.6 points at 3 and 12 months was greater than published reductions of 1.1 points at 3 and 12 months. The upper-extremity reduction in spasticity was noticeably greater at 3 and 12 months (1.7 and 2.0 points, respectively) than published results at 3 and 12 months (0.4 and 0.6 points, respectively). At 3, 6, and 12 months, our mean baclofen dosage remained below the dosages administered at the T11-T12 level. There were no complications related either to the positioning of the catheter higher in the spinal canal or to the administration of baclofen at the T6-T7 level. CONCLUSION: Compared with published results, placement of the tip of the intrathecal catheter at the T6-T7 level was associated with greater relief of upper-extremity spasticity without loss of effect on the lower extremities. The mean dosages of baclofen in our study group were lower compared with mean dosages administered at the T11-T12 level. There was no morbidity related to the more rostral location of the catheter.","Baclofen/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, *Catheters, Indwelling, Child, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Quadriplegia/*drug therapy, Thoracic Vertebrae, Treatment Outcome",-1

Because these patients may have a visceral pain syndrome unrelated to myocardial ischemia, we investigated whether drugs that are useful in chronic pain syndromes might also be beneficial in such patients. METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients underwent cardiac, esophageal, psychiatric, and pain-sensitivity testing and then participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled three-week trial of clonidine at a dose of 0.1 mg twice daily (20 patients), imipramine at a dose of 50 mg nightly with a morning placebo (20 patients), or placebo twice daily (20 patients); this treatment phase was compared with an identical period of twice-daily placebo for all patients (placebo phase). RESULTS: Thirteen (22 percent) of the 60 patients had ischemic-appearing electrocardiographic responses to exercise, 22 of the 54 tested (41 percent) had abnormal esophageal motility, 38 of 60 (63 percent) had one or more psychiatric disorders, and 52 of 60 (87 percent) had their characteristic chest pain provoked by right ventricular electrical stimulation or intracoronary infusion of adenosine. During the treatment phase, the imipramine group had a mean (+/- SD) reduction of 52 +/- 25 percent in episodes of chest pain, the clonidine group had a reduction of 39 +/- 51 percent, and the placebo group a reduction of 1 +/- 86 percent, all as compared with the placebo phase of the trial. Only the improvement with imipramine was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Repeat assessment of sensitivity to cardiac pain while the patients were receiving treatment showed significant improvement only in the imipramine group (P = 0.01). The response to imipramine did not depend on the results of cardiac, esophageal, or psychiatric testing at base line, or on the change in the psychiatric profile during the course of the study, which generally improved in all three study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Imipramine improved the symptoms of patients with chest pain and normal coronary angiograms, possibly through a visceral analgesic effect.","Adult, Aged, Chest Pain/*drug therapy, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, *Coronary Angiography, Coronary Disease/diagnosis/physiopathology, Double-Blind Method, Electrocardiography, Exercise Test, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Imipramine/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged",-1

METHODS: A noninterventional observational cohort study was conducted by using the technique of prescription-event monitoring. Patients were identified from dispensed National Health Service prescriptions. Outcome data were obtained from questionnaires sent to the doctor approximately 6 months after the initial prescription. These data included demographic information, events reported since starting GBP, and reason for stopping the drug, if it was stopped. Incidence rates were calculated for given periods for all events reported. Additional information was requested for selected events of medical interest, including pregnancies. Standardised mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 3,100 patients, of whom 136 (4%) were children. The median duration of treatment was 8.1 months. The most frequently reported adverse events reported during the first month of treatment, drowsiness/sedation, dizziness, and malaise/lassitude, also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing GBP and reported as suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). There were no congenital anomalies in the 11 babies born to women who used GBP during the first trimester of pregnancy. Crude mortality rate was 5 times that in general population but similar to that in other published studies. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic-related events were the most frequently reported adverse events. They also were the commonest reasons for discontinuing treatment and reported as suspected ADRs. No previously unrecognised adverse events were detected in this large cohort of patients who were among the first treated with gabapentin in England.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/*statistics & numerical data, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Cause of Death, Child, Child, Preschool, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Eruptions/etiology, Drug Therapy, Combination, England, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/mortality, Exanthema/chemically induced, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Middle Aged, Product Surveillance, Postmarketing/methods/*statistics & numerical data, Sleep Stages, Weight Gain, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

METHODS: Patients with partial seizures with and/or without secondary generalization or primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures were randomized to either GBP or LTG. During 2- and 6-week titration periods, respectively, GBP dosage reached 1,800 mg/day, and LTG, 150 mg/day. In the subsequent 24-week maintenance phase, the dose could be adjusted based on seizure control or adverse events between 1,200 and 3,600 mg/day for GBP and 100 and 300 mg/day for LTG. The primary end point was time to exit, a composite of efficacy and tolerability. Evaluable patients were used for the primary efficacy analysis, whereas tolerability was examined on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: A total of 309 patients was randomized, and 291 (148 GBP, 143 LTG) were included in the evaluable population. Nineteen patients in each group had an exit event. The median time to exit was 69 days for GBP and 48 days for LTG. The hazard ratio was estimated as 1.043 (90% confidence intervals, 0.602-1.809). Overall, 106 (71.6% of the evaluable population) GBP-treated and 96 (67.1%) LTG-treated patients completed the study. Of those, 80 (75.5%) patients taking GBP and 73 (76.0%) taking LTG remained seizure free during the final 12 weeks of treatment. Only 14 (8.9%) GBP-treated patients and 15 (9.9%) LTG-treated patients withdrew because of study drug-related adverse events.

Effectiveness of electrotherapy and amitriptyline for symptomatic relief.,"Kumar D, Alvaro MS, Julka IS, Marshall HJ",Diabetes Care. 1998 Aug;21(8):1322-5.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combining electrotherapy with amitriptyline for the management of chronic painful peripheral neuropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 26) with peripheral neuropathy were treated with amitriptyline. After 4 weeks, those patients (n = 23) who failed to respond to amitriptyline or who only had partial relief were randomized between a sham treatment group (control) or an electrotherapy group. Transcutaneous electrotherapy was given for 12 weeks by a portable unit (H-wave machine) that generated a biphasic exponentially decaying waveform (pulse width 4 ms, 25-35 V, > or = 2 Hz). The degree of pain and discomfort was graded on a scale of 0-5. An analog scale was used to record the overall change in symptoms. RESULTS: Amitriptyline produced some degree of symptomatic relief in 15 (60%) of the 26 patients by the 4th week; pain scores decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.2 (P < 0.1) and the overall reduction in pain was 26 +/- 5% on an analog scale. In the amitriptyline plus sham treatment group (n = 9), pain scores declined from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 (P < 0.03) and the overall reduction in pain was 55 +/- 12%, suggesting a procedure-related placebo effect. In the group receiving combined electrotherapy and amitriptyline (n = 14), symptomatic improvement occurred in 12 (85%) patients. Five (36%) of the patients in this group became asymptomatic. Pain scores declined from 3.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.4 (P < 0.01) and the overall reduction in pain was 66 +/- 10%. The degree of reduction in pain scores and the incremental relief (above the amitriptyline effect) were significantly greater (P < 0.03) with electrotherapy as compared with sham treatment. The outcomes indicate a substantial beneficial effect of electrotherapy over and above any placebo influence. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical observations suggest that transcutaneous electrotherapy is effective in reducing the pain associated with peripheral neuropathy. This form of therapy may be a useful adjunctive modality when it is combined with a pharmacological agent, such as amitriptyline, to augment symptomatic relief.","Adult, Aged, Amitriptyline/*therapeutic use, Diabetic Neuropathies/*physiopathology/therapy, *Electric Stimulation Therapy/methods, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuralgia/*therapy, Pain Measurement, Single-Blind Method",-1

Prior to pump implantation, a baclofen bolus test (BBT) is used to assess the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen using clinical scales such as the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). In the literature, the time and period of maximum effect of a bolus dose of intrathecally administered baclofen in patients with cerebral spasticity is variously reported. The aim of the study was, therefore, to reveal the time course of the effect of a BBT on severe cerebral spasticity by the use of a recently described spasticity measurement method. Spasticity in knee joints of 13 patients with severe cerebral spasticity was repeatedly assessed using the MAS and also continuously recorded by the measurement of force under circular fibreglass casts. Force was recorded as nettorque by multiplying the force by the distance between sensor and joint axis, thus allowing inter-individual comparison. Half-hour time integrals (TI) of net-torque were determined 9 hours before and 22 hours after intrathecal baclofen administration. Post-BBT half-hour time integrals (TI(+0), TI(+0.5), to TI(+22)) were compared with the mean of 17 pre-BBT half-hour time integrals. Significantly lower post-BBT half-hour time integrals compared with were found between TI(+2) and TI(+8) (Dunnett adjusted p < 0.05). The median lowest TI after BBT of the 13 patients was TI(+4). The lowest mean MAS scores were found 4 hours after BBT. The findings suggest that the greatest effect of BBT on cerebral spasticity occurs between 2 and 8.5 hours, with a maximal effect at 4 hours after intrathecal baclofen injection. Clinical scales used to determine the effect of BBT should thus be carried out during this period-ideally at 4 hours after baclofen injection.","Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology, Brain Diseases/*complications, Female, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Knee Joint/pathology, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors",-1
12775194,Management of neurocysticercosis.,"Riley T, White AC Jr",CNS Drugs. 2003;17(8):577-91.,"Neurocysticercosis is a common cause of neurological disease in developing countries and a major cause of epilepsy worldwide. A unique characteristic of human neurocysticercosis is that the living parasite is very well tolerated in human brain, so symptoms and clinical disease primarily result from death of the organism and accompanying inflammatory reaction in the human CNS. Among the diverse clinical manifestations of human neurocysticercosis, seizures are the most common, but other clinical problems occur, depending upon the localisation and viability of the parasite. Although both praziquantel and albendazole are effective agents, there is controversy about their role in several forms of the disease. Systematic reviews have pointed out the limited quality of available data on therapy. At a recent international conference convened to develop guidelines for treatment of this disease, areas of consensus and disagreement on the role of antiparasitic therapy were discussed. It was clear to all that cysticercosis cannot be regarded as a single disorder; treatment needs to be modified based on the location and number of cysticerci and the host response. There was a strong consensus that there is no role for antiparasitic drugs in patients with only calcified lesions. Studies suggest that patients with single enhancing lesions will do well regardless of antiparasitic therapy. Antiparasitic drugs are contraindicated in patients with cerebral oedema (cysticercal encephalitis). Most experts strongly recommend antiparasitic therapy in patients with multiple subarachnoid cysticerci or giant cysticerci. In patients with ventricular cysticerci, endoscopic removal is the preferred therapy. However, recent evidence suggests that placement of a ventricular shunt followed by antiparasitic therapy is an acceptable alternative. Standard treatment for localization-related epilepsy is effective for seizures caused by cysticercosis. In general, seizures are easily controlled in this illness. While many controversies regarding the treatment of patients with neurocysticercosis were not resolved at the international consensus conference, participants did conclude that controlled prospective studies are required to define optimal therapy for the infection and that treatment of infected individuals must be individualised.","Antiparasitic Agents/*therapeutic use, Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology, Epilepsy/drug therapy/etiology/microbiology, Humans, Neurocysticercosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology",-1
9474712,Migraine treatment.,"Young WB, Silberstein SD, Dayno JM",Semin Neurol. 1997;17(4):325-33.,"Migraine is a primary headache disorder characterized by recurring attacks of pain and associated symptoms. Migraine sufferers require a continuum of clinical care that depends on their disability and response to treatment. Treatment consists of: (1) prevention of attacks by avoidance of triggers; (2) the use of nonpharmacologic treatments; (3) treatment of the acute attack; and (4) long-term prophylactic therapy. Migraine is comorbid for affective disorders, epilepsy, stroke, and mitral valve prolapse. The therapy selected depends on the headache severity and frequency, the pattern of associated symptoms, comorbid illnesses, and the patient's treatment response profile. Acute treatment can be symptomatic or specific, using drugs such as dihydroergotamine (DHE) or sumatriptan. Preventive treatment can be episodic, subacute, or chronic. The major drug groups include beta-adrenergic blockers, anti-depressants, calcium channel blockers, serotonin antagonists, anticonvulsants, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These can be divided into two major categories and second-line choices.","Analgesics/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Biofeedback, Psychology, Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Migraine Disorders/drug therapy/prevention & control/*therapy, Nerve Block, Serotonin Antagonists/adverse effects/therapeutic use",-1

The neurological examination of the sensory system in neuropathic pain patients guides the anatomical localization of the injury. Among the sensory modalities to be tested, priority should be given to those subserved by small peripheral sensory fibers or by the spinothalamic tract that most commonly are abnormal in neuropathic pain patients. Testing of cold and warm perception was traditionally carried out in the clinic using tubes filled with water at different temperatures, a cumbersome method that has limited the routine examination of these sensory modalities. The Lindblom roller offers a practical and effective method of readily testing temperature perception and is among the best available clinical tools for delineating the anatomical boundaries of a sensory abnormality. Routinely use of the Lindblom roller shall be standard bedside clinical assessment of neuropathic pain patients. To exemplify this statement we describe two patients affected by complex and fluctuating painful sensory abnormalities caused by an extradural mass compressing the spinal cord. The level of the injury was readily localized with a roller kept at room temperature.","Aged, Cold Temperature/adverse effects, Female, Hemangioma/*complications/diagnosis, Humans, Hypesthesia/diagnosis/etiology, Meningeal Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis, Meningioma/*complications/diagnosis, Middle Aged, Pain/*diagnosis/*etiology, Pain Measurement/*instrumentation, Point-of-Care Systems, Spinal Cord Neoplasms/*complications/diagnosis",-1

Diagnostic ERCP is declining in importance and has held its position mainly due to new advances in tissue sampling, pressure measurement, and the use of echo probes and miniature endoscopes.

Seventeen participants (nine females, eight males; mean age 9 years 10 months, SE 10 months) served as their own control. Their mean Gross Motor Function Classification System score was 2.7 (SD 0.4; range 1 to 5). HBRT was 1 hour per week for three riding sessions of 6 weeks per session (18 weeks). GMFM was determined every 6 weeks: pre-riding control period, onset of HBRT, every 6 weeks during HBRT for 18 weeks, and 6 weeks following HBRT. GMFM did not change during pre-riding control period. GMFM Total Score (Dimensions A-E) increased 7.6% (p<0.04) after 18 weeks, returning to control level 6 weeks following HBRT. GMFM Dimension E (Walking, Running, and Jumping) increased 8.7% after 12 weeks (p<0.02), 8.5% after 18 weeks (p<0.03), and remained elevated at 1.8% 6 weeks following HBRT (p<0.03). This suggests that HBRT may improve gross motor function in children with CP, which may reduce the degree of motor disability. Larger studies are needed to investigate this further, especially in children. with more severe disabilities. Horseback riding should be considered for sports therapy in children with CP.","Animals, Cerebral Palsy/rehabilitation/*therapy, Child, Female, *Horses, Humans, Male, Psychomotor Performance, *Recreation, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1
10776832,A review of the epidemiology and approaches to the treatment of social anxiety disorder.,"Sareen L, Stein M",Drugs. 2000 Mar;59(3):497-509.,"This review presents current literature on the epidemiology and treatment of social anxiety disorder (social phobia). This illness has been demonstrated to be the most common anxiety disorder with a 1-year prevalence of 7 to 8% and a lifetime prevalence of 13 to 14% in patients aged between 15 and 54 years. Social anxiety disorder can be classified into 2 subtypes, discrete and generalised. Morbidity is high with this disorder, and 70 to 80% of patients have co-morbid mental disorders. Although effective treatments are available, social anxiety disorder is under-recognised and under-treated. Treatments that have been systemically studied and have shown efficacy in patients with social anxiety disorder include pharmacotherapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine-A and benzodiazepines) and short term psychotherapies (cognitive behaviour therapy, social skills training and exposure in vivo therapy). Beta-blockers are useful in treating performance-related anxiety. Few published data are available on the treatment of social anxiety disorder with a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. We conclude this review by discussing proposed algorithms for treating both subtypes of social anxiety disorder.","Adolescent, Adult, Algorithms, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Behavior Therapy/methods, Comorbidity, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, *Phobic Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy, Prevalence, Prognosis, Psychotherapy",-1

METHODS: A prospective study was performed for 6 periods of 8 days each. Epidemiologic data (e.g., age, gender, medical history), drug utilization, and adverse drug reactions on patients hospitalized during these periods were collected by a pharmacy student. RESULTS: A total of 156 patients (70 men and 86 women) were included in the study. The patients' mean age +/- SD was 66.5 +/- 18.1 years and mean length of stay was 13.2 +/- 9 days. Renal and hepatic insufficiency and previous history of drug intolerance were observed in 17.9%, 10.2%, and 2% of the hospitalized patients, respectively. Thirty-eight ADEs occurred in 32 patients; in 15 cases, ADEs were identified as the reason for admission, 10 cases occurred during hospitalization, and 13 cases were present at admission, but were not the cause of admission. The most frequent ADEs involved the neurologic (23.6%), renal (15.7%), and hematologic (13.1%) systems. Among these 38 ADEs, 22 were considered avoidable (57.9%); 20 of these were associated with therapeutic errors (inappropriate administration, drug-drug interactions, dosage error, drug not stopped despite the onset of ADEs). Patients with ADEs stayed longer in the hospital and took more drugs both before and during their hospital stay (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Most of the ADEs observed in this study were avoidable. The risk/benefit ratio of administered drugs could be improved with better knowledge of the patients' medical history and the risk factors of ADEs.","Adult, Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Drug Hypersensitivity/epidemiology, *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Female, *Hospitalization, Humans, Length of Stay, Male, Medication Errors, Middle Aged, Pharmacy Service, Hospital, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors",-1
10776831,Drugs used to treat spasticity.,"Kita M, Goodkin DE",Drugs. 2000 Mar;59(3):487-95.,"Spasticity is a common and disabling symptom for many patients with upper motor neuron dysfunction. It results from interruption of inhibitory descending spinal motor pathways, and although the pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly understood, the final common pathway is overactivity of the alpha motor neuron. Therapy for spasticity is symptomatic with the aim of increasing functional capacity and relieving discomfort. Any approach to treatment should be multidisciplinary, including physical therapy, and possibly surgery, as well as pharmacotherapy. It is important that treatment be tailored to the individual patient, and that both patient and care giver have realistic expectations. Pharmacotherapy is generally initiated at low dosages and then gradually increased in an attempt to avoid adverse effects. Optimal therapy is the lowest effective dosage. Baclofen, diazepam, tizanidine and dantrolene are currently approved for use in patients with spasticity. In addition, clonidine (usually as combination therapy), gabapentin and botulinum toxin have shown efficacy, however, more studies are required to confirm their place in therapy. Intrathecal baclofen, via a surgically implanted pump and reservoir, may provide relief in patients with refractory severe spasticity.","Baclofen/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Clonidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs &, derivatives/therapeutic use, Dantrolene/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Diazepam/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Drug Administration Schedule, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic, use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/physiopathology/therapy",-1

A case report.,"Nickerson RB, Atchison JW, Van Hoose JD, Hayes D",Am J Phys Med Rehabil. 1997 Mar-Apr;76(2):144-6.,"We present a case of persistent hiccups (singultus) after a lateral medullary cerebrovascular accident. The patient presented with a two-day history of nausea and vomiting. Clinically, the patient had a loss of pain and temperature on the left side of the face, a loss of pain and temperature on the right side of the trunk, a mild left hemiparesis, and a left-sided ataxia. Nystagmus, diplopia, and hiccups were also evident. A left lateral medullary syndrome in the vascular distribution of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery was diagnosed. Work-up included a magnetic resonance imaging angiogram, which revealed an occlusion v high-grade stenosis of the basilar artery. The patient reported that the most distressing symptom was the chronic hiccups (25/min), which interfered with nutrition, sleep, and activity. While in the acute care hospital, the patient was treated with prochlorperazine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine. Each of these medications was unsuccessful in stopping the hiccups. After a search of the European literature revealed that baclofen was recommended as the drug of choice for stopping persistent hiccups, the patient was given 5 mg of baclofen by mouth three times per day, and the hiccups abated within 48 hours. The baclofen was discontinued after one week of therapy, and the hiccups did not return. We recommend consideration of baclofen for the treatment of persistent hiccups after lateral medullary syndrome because of its desirable side effects and reported success rate compared with other drugs used to treat chronic hiccups.","Aged, Antiemetics/therapeutic use, Arterial Occlusive Diseases/*physiopathology, Baclofen/therapeutic use, *Basilar Artery, GABA Agonists/therapeutic use, Hiccup/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Humans, Male, Medulla Oblongata/*blood supply, Nausea/physiopathology, Syndrome, Vomiting/physiopathology",-1
9399364,Benzodiazepine self-administration in humans and laboratory animals--implications for problems of long-term use and abuse.,"Griffiths RR, Weerts EM",Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1997 Nov;134(1):1-37.,"Drug reinforcement may represent the primary behavioral-pharmacological mechanism underlying two types of problematic use of benzodiazepines--recreational abuse by polydrug abusers and inappropriate chronic use by patients. High dose polydrug abuse for the purpose of getting high is readily recognized as a significant social problem. Inappropriate chronic benzodiazepine use is more subtle but relatively common: for anxiolytics, 36% of past-year users (3% of the adult population in the US) report using these drugs for 4 consecutive months or longer. The risks of such long-term use are much better documented than the benefits. This paper provides a current review of various problems that have been identified with the long-term use and the recreational abuse of benzodiazepines, including memory impairment, risk of accidents, falls and hip fractures in the elderly, a withdrawal syndrome, brain damage, overuse in the elderly, overuse by chronic pain patients, overuse by alcoholics and recreational abuse among alcoholics and polydrug abusers. A comprehensive review of the literature on benzodiazepine reinforcing effects in humans and laboratory animals is also provided. Drug self-administration studies in humans and laboratory animals provide models of both types of problematic benzodiazepine use. Recreational abuse of benzodiazepines has been modeled in human research with polydrug abusers and in laboratory animal studies, which show that the reinforcing effect of benzodiazepines is intermediate relative to other sedative compounds and is increased in subjects with histories of previous sedative drug self-administration. The problem of inappropriate long-term use of benzodiazepines by people without histories of drug abuse has been partially modeled in human studies showing that benzodiazepines function as reinforcers in subjects with anxiety, insomnia, and histories of moderate alcohol consumption, and in preclinical studies showing stable, low-rate benzodiazepine self-injection with concurrent physical dependence under conditions of continuous availability. Both human and animal research suggests that the drug history and current behavioral context may be important in the establishment of benzodiazepines as reinforcers. Limited human and animal research provides little support for the common belief that physical dependence enhances benzodiazepine reinforcement.","Animals, Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Benzodiazepines, Humans, Self Administration/*psychology, Substance-Related Disorders/*psychology",-1

OBJECTIVE: To describe the presentation of cerebral malaria in the age group one to twelve years. DESIGN: Prospective study conducted from May to September 1997, the rainy season during which malaria occurs in epidemics in the highlands of Kenya. SETTING: Paediatric wards of the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital, Eldoret which is the Teaching Hospital for Moi University and the referral centre for surrounding districts of Western Kenya, with an altitude of over 2000 metres above sea level. PATIENTS: Twenty three consecutive children aged one to twelve years with cerebral malaria as defined by the WHO were studied. All children were treated with the standard quinine regimen for cerebral malaria. RESULTS: Majority of the children were six to ten years of age with 95.7% having a normal weight for age. 91.3%, 89.5% and 72.2% had fever, headache and convulsions respectively. 68.1% had a short duration of illness (less than three days) with only 9.5% presenting with hypoglycaemia. Severe anaemia was not observed but 72% had mild to moderate anaemia. Hyperparasitaemia (parasite counts greater than 100,000 per microlitre) was found in majority of the cases. CONCLUSION: Cerebral malaria presentation in the highlands is similar to that among non-immune populations and is an acute fulminant illness presenting with coma, hyperparasitaemia, fever and convulsions in children with normal nutritional status.","Altitude, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Kenya, Malaria, Cerebral/*diagnosis, Male, Prospective Studies, Rural Population",-1
11504596,Newer antiepileptic drugs: advantages and disadvantages.,Wallace SJ,Brain Dev. 2001 Aug;23(5):277-83.,"The choice of an antiepileptic drug depends firstly on its efficacy in specific seizure types and epilepsies. However, it is imperative to consider whether possible adverse events will outweigh any benefits. The advantages and disadvantages of vigabatrin, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, tiagabine and felbamate are considered in some detail, and oxcarbazepine, stiripentol, remacemide, zonisamide and levetiracetam more briefly. Vigabatrin is effective for partial seizures and infantile spasms, but visual field defects are limiting its use. Lamotrigine has a wide spectrum, needs to be prescribed with care. Gabapentin is unlikely to cause adverse effects, but has relatively poor efficacy. Topiramate is widely effective, but can be poorly tolerated. Tiagabine is relatively untried in childhood epilepsies. The use of felbamate is restricted to severe refractory epilepsies. Stiripentol can be effective in severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy. Zonisamide has a special place in the progressive myoclonus epilepsies. Levetiracetam, remacemide and oxcarbazepine have been used mainly for partial seizures: further studies of their roles in other circumstances are required.","Adolescent, Adult, Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Female, Humans, Male, Treatment Outcome",-1
11772289,Advances in pharmacological treatment of migraine.,"Diener HC, Limmroth V",Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2001 Oct;10(10):1831-45.,"Migraine is a paroxysmal disorder with attacks of headache, nausea, vomiting, photo- and phonophobia and malaise. This review summarises new treatment options both for the therapy of the acute attack as well as for migraine prophylaxis. Analgesics like aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in treating migraine attacks. Few controlled trials were performed for the use of ergotamine or dihydroergotamine. These trials indicate inferior efficacy compared with serotonin (5-HT(1B/D)) agonists (triptans). The triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan), are highly effective. They improve headache as well as nausea, photo- and phonophobia. The different triptans show only minor differences in efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse effects. The knowledge of their different pharmacological profile allows a more specific treatment of the individual migraine characteristics. Migraine prophylaxis is recommended, when more than three attacks occur per month, if attacks do not respond to acute treatment or if side effects of acute treatment are severe. Substances with proven efficacy include the beta-blockers metoprolol and propranolol, the calcium channel blocker flunarizine, several 5-HT antagonists and amitriptyline. Recently anti-epileptic drugs (valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate) were evaluated for the prophylaxis of migraine. The use of botulinum toxin is under investigation.","Adult, Aged, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Child, Female, Humans, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Pregnancy, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/*therapeutic use",-1
8968657,Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.,Baumann P,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1996 Dec;31(6):444-69.,"The recently introduced antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline], are known for their clinical efficacy, good tolerability and relative safety. They differ from each other in chemical structure, metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties. Therapeutic drug monitoring of these compounds is not widely used, as the plasma concentration ranges within which clinical response with minimal adverse effects appears to be optimal are not clearly defined. Almost all recent assays developed for the quantitative determination of SSRIs and their metabolites in blood are based either on the separation of SSRIs by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or gas chromatography (GC). Citalopram and fluoxetine have been introduced as racemic compounds. There are some differences in the pharmacological profile, metabolism and pharmacokinetics between the enantiomers of the parent compounds and their demethylated metabolites. Stereoselective chromatographic methods for their analysis in blood are now available. With regard to the SSRIs presently available, no clearcut plasma concentration-clinical effectiveness relationship in patients with depression has been shown, nor any threshold which defines toxic concentrations. This may be explained by their low toxicity and use at dosages where serious adverse effects do not appear. SSRIs vary widely in their qualitative and quantitative interaction with cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes in the liver. CYP2D6 is inhibited by SSRIs, in order of decreasing potency paroxetine, norfluoxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram and fluvoxamine. This may have clinical consequences with some but not all SSRIs, when they are taken with tricyclic antidepressants. Except for citalopram and paroxetine, little is known about the enzymes which control the biotransformation of the SSRIs. There have been many reports on marked pharmacokinetic interactions between fluoxetine and tricyclic antidepressants. Fluoxetine has a stronger effect on their hydroxylation than on their demethylation. Interactions observed between fluoxetine and alprazolam, midazolam and carbamazepine seem to occur on the level of CYP3A. Fluvoxamine strongly inhibits the N-demethylation of some tricyclic antidepressants of the tertiary amine type and of clozapine. This may lead to adverse effects but augmentation with fluvoxamine can also improve response in very rapid metabolisers, as it increases the bioavailability of the comedication. Fluvoxamine inhibits with decreasing potency, CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP1A1, but it is also an inhibitor of CYP3A. Fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have shown to increase methadone plasma concentrations in dependent patients. Some authors warn about a combination of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors with SSRIs, as this could lead to a serotonergic syndrome. Studies with healthy volunteers suggest, however, that a combination of moclobemide and SSRIs, such as fluvoxamine, should not present serious risks in promoting a serotonin syndrome. A combination of moclobemide and fluvoxamine has successfully been used in refractory depression, but more studies are needed, including plasma-concentration monitoring, before this combined treatment can be recommended. Paroxetine is a substrate of CYP2D6, but other enzyme(s) could also be involved. Its pharmacokinetics are linear in poor metabolisers of sparteine, and non-linear in extensive metabolisers. Due to its potent CYP2D6 inhibiting properties, comedication with this SSRI can lead to an increase of tricyclic antidepressants in plasma, as shown with amitriptyline and trimipramine. CYP3A has been claimed to be involved in the biotransformation of sertraline to norsertraline. Clinical investigations (with desipramine) confirmed in vitro findings that CYP2D6 inhibition by sertraline is only moderate.

11256460,Ketoconazole in bipolar patients with depressive symptoms: a case series and literature review.,"Brown ES, Bobadilla L, Rush AJ",Bipolar Disord. 2001 Feb;3(1):23-9.,"BACKGROUND: Data from several studies suggest that medications, such as ketoconazole, which lower cortisol levels, may be effective for major depressive disorder (MDD). As with MDD, the manic, depressive, and mixed phases of bipolar disorder are frequently associated with elevated cortisol levels. The literature on the use of cortisol-lowering strategies in mood disorders is reviewed, and a case series illustrating the use of ketoconazole in bipolar depression is presented. METHODS: For the review, the MEDLINE and PSYCHINFO databases were searched, as were the bibliographies of pertinent articles to find papers on the use of cortisol-lowering agents in patients with mood disorders. In our open-label case series (n = 6), ketoconazole (up to 800 mg/day) as an add-on therapy was given to patients with treatment-resistant or intolerant bipolar I or II disorders with current symptoms of depression. RESULTS: Several case reports and small open studies suggest that cortisol-lowering agents may be useful for patients with depression. Two recent placebo-controlled trials of ketoconazole on patients with MDD report conflicting results. In our case series, all three patients who received a dose of at least 400 mg/day had substantial reductions in depressive symptoms. None had significant increases in mania. However, cortisol levels were not lowered in any of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The literature suggests that cortisol-lowering medications may be effective for a subset of depressed patients. Our preliminary findings suggest that ketoconazole may be useful in some patients with bipolar depression. Larger clinical trials are needed to confirm our observations.","Adult, Antidepressive Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism, Humans, Hydrocortisone/metabolism, Ketoconazole/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Treatment Outcome",-1
10348093,Safety issues concerning the use of disulfiram in treating alcohol dependence.,Chick J,Drug Saf. 1999 May;20(5):427-35.,"Disulfiram is known to cause hepatitis, which is sometimes fatal. The best estimate of the frequency of disulfiram-induced fatal hepatitis is 1 case in 30,000 patients treated/year. Its appears to be more common in patients given disulfiram for the treatment of nickel sensitivity. Frequent blood testing for liver function is probably not necessary, but patients taking disulfiram should be in regular contact with a physician. There are rare reports of psychosis and confusional states in conjunction with disulfiram treatment and peripheral neuropathy and optic neuritis have been reported; these effects are dose-related. Psychiatric complications appear to be more common with the use of disulfiram in India than in Western countries. Of the less serious adverse effects, tiredness, headache and sleepiness are the most common. Deaths from the disulfiram-alcohol (ethanol) interaction have not been reported in recent years, possibly because the dosages used are lower than those used 40 years ago, and patients with cardiac disease are now excluded from treatment. There is no evidence to suggest that disulfiram causes cancer. Of note, there are drug interactions with compounds that utilise the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Disulfiram can be viewed as a drug with a moderate record of adverse effects. Alcohol dependence, for which it can be a helpful treatment, is associated with a high morbidity and mortality.","Alcohol Deterrents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Alcoholism/*drug therapy, Central Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced, Disulfiram/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Drug-Induced Liver Injury, Female, Humans, Male",-1

This paper summarizes preliminary experiences with transdermal histamine for MS at the Tahoma Clinic: 67 percent of 55 patients using histamine transdermal cream had improvements in one or more areas, including extremity strength, balance, bladder control, fatigue, activities of daily living, and cognitive functioning, sustained for periods of up to three months. One-third of patients had improvements in three or more areas of functioning. Five possible mechanisms of action are postulated: augmentation of subnormal cerebral tissue levels of histamine; improved electrical function of demyelinated fibers; increased cerebral blood flow; suppression of autoimmune responses; and stimulation of remyelination. These will be discussed in detail in Part 2 of this article.","Administration, Cutaneous, Adult, Aged, Female, Histamine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/classification/*drug therapy/physiopathology",-1

Accurate diagnosis is essential before treatment is prescribed and should involve complete history taking, thorough neurological examination and evaluation of possible associated factors. The most frequently used drugs for the acute treatment of TTH are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of which only some have been shown to be efficacious in placebo-controlled trials. Amitriptyline remains the first choice treatment for prophylaxis. Other antidepressants, muscle relaxants and benzodiazepines may be used, but few have been evaluated adequately in placebo-controlled trials. Biofeedback and relaxation training, demonstrated efficacious by controlled studies, may be used when the aim is to avoid the side effects of pharmacological treatment.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Behavior Therapy, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Tension-Type Headache/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology",-1

The drug has been shown to have an antinociceptive action and is used effectively in the management of spasticity. Baclofen was first used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in 1980 and is currently used in the management of various types of neuropathic pain. The effect of baclofen on migraine has not been previously studied. The aim of the present open pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of baclofen in patients with migraine. Fifty-four patients with migraine with and without aura who experienced 4-8 migraine attacks during a 4-week baseline were included. Baclofen, 15-40 mgs, was given in three divided doses for 12 weeks. Headache frequency and severity were recorded. Fifty-one patients completed the trial. Baclofen was found to be effective in 86.2% with > or = 50% headache reduction from baseline. Three patients could not tolerate the drug due to adverse events. In this open study, baclofen was found to be effective for prophylactic treatment of migraine.","Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, GABA Agonists/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/diagnosis/*prevention & control, Recurrence, Treatment Outcome",-1

Suggestions are made to improve liaison between primary and secondary care as well as epilepsy management in primary care. All 42 local primary care practices were invited to take part in this project. A study day providing a broad overview of epilepsy management was held. Those attending were expected to identify all patients in their practice with epilepsy using diagnostic codes and prescribing data. Nine of the invited 42 practices took part in the project, and identified 506 patients prescribed anti-epilepsy drugs (AEDs). Three hundred and three patients were invited for review by their practice nurse, following exclusion of those prescribed AEDs for other conditions, children and those already under specialist review. One hundred and sixteen patients attended for review. Seventy-one patients were identified as requiring specialist review and a consultant neurologist, epilepsy nurse specialist and clinical assistant completed them. Of the 71 patients 31 had experienced no seizures for 5 years, 40 had experienced seizures in the past 5 years, of whom 32 had experienced seizures in the last year. Sixteen were suffering at least one seizure per month, and a few had poorly controlled epilepsy. Patients were taking mainly Phenytoin, Carbamazepine and Sodium valproate. Twenty were taking polytherapy and one no treatment.Fifty-two patients reported side effects and 15 poor compliance. Many patients reviewed were considered to be taking unnecessary medication and suffering unnecessary side effects.

A retrospective medical records review was conducted on all patients who were admitted to our psychiatric/rehabilitation facility over a 36-month period and who had received buspirone therapy. Monthly behavioral therapy records were used to determine the quality and quantity of aggressive-related behaviors. Study endpoint was reached in each subject when buspirone was discontinued or when records were unavailable. Twenty subjects, ranging in age from 15 to 55 years old (mu = 26.1 +/- 9.8), were identified for study. Nine (90%) of 10 subjects for whom data were available for at least 3 months showed an improvement in behavior by study endpoint, and 6 (60%) showed at least a 50% reduction in behavioral symptoms by study endpoint. Results from this study suggest that buspirone is well tolerated and may be effective in the treatment of aggressive and other maladaptive behaviors in individuals with an organic component to their psychiatric illness, particularly traumatic brain injury. Prospective, controlled trials are needed to validate these findings.","Adolescent, Adult, Aggression/*drug effects/psychology, Buspirone/*therapeutic use, Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic, Cognitive Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies",-1

9034418,Possible serotonin syndrome associated with tramadol and sertraline coadministration.,"Mason BJ, Blackburn KH",Ann Pharmacother. 1997 Feb;31(2):175-7.,"OBJECTIVE: To report a possible case of serotonin syndrome associated with coadministration of tramadol hydrochloride and sertraline hydrochloride. CASE SUMMARY: A 42-year-old woman developed atypical chest pain, sinus tachycardia, confusion, psychosis, sundowning, agitation, diaphoresis, and tremor. She was taking multiple medications, including tramadol and sertraline. The tramadol dosage had recently been increased, resulting in what was believed to be serotonergic syndrome. DISCUSSION: Serotonin syndrome is a toxic hyperserotonergic state that develops soon after initiation or dosage increments of the offending agent. Patients may differ in their susceptibility to the development of serotonin syndrome. The (+) enantiomer of tramadol inhibits serotonin uptake. Tramadol is metabolized to an active metabolite, M1, by the CYP2D6 enzyme. If this metabolite has less serotonergic activity than tramadol, inhibition of CYP2D6 by sertraline could have been a factor in the interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the potential for serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of sertraline and tramadol.","1-Naphthylamine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives, Adult, Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects, Antidepressive Agents/*adverse effects, Drug Interactions, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Receptors, Serotonin/drug effects, Serotonin/*metabolism, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*adverse effects, Sertraline, Syndrome, Tramadol/*adverse effects",-1

The arms are the most common body part affected and cause the most functional disability. The treatment of essential tremor includes medications, surgical options and other forms of therapy. Presently there is no cure for essential tremor nor are there any medications that can slow the progression of tremor. Treatment for essential tremor is recommended if the tremor causes functional disability. If the tremor is disabling only during periods of stress and anxiety, propranolol and benzodiazepines can be used during those periods when the tremor causes functional disability. The currently available medications can improve tremor in approximately 50% of the patients. If the tremor is disabling, treatment should be initiated with either primidone or propranolol. If either primidone or propranolol do not provide adequate control of the tremor, then the medications can be used in combination. If patients experience adverse effects with propranolol, occasionally other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (such as atenolol or metoprolol) can be used. If primidone and propranolol do not provide adequate control of tremor, occasionally the use of benzodiazepines (such as clonazepam) can provide benefit. Other medications that may be helpful include gabapentin or topiramate. If a patient has disabling head or voice tremor, botulinum toxin injections into the muscles may provide relief from the tremor. Botulinum toxin in the hand muscles for hand tremor can result in bothersome hand weakness and is not widely used. There are other medications that have been tried in essential tremor and have questionable efficacy. These drugs include carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. methazolamide), phenobarbital, calcium channel antagonists (e.g. nimodipine), isoniazid, clonidine, clozapine and mirtazapine. If the patient still has disabling tremor after medication trials, surgical options are usually considered. Surgical options include thalamotomy and deep brain stimulation of the thalamus. These surgical options provide adequate tremor control in approximately 90% of the patients. Surgical morbidity and mortality for these procedures is low. Deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy have been shown to have comparable efficacy but fewer complications have been reported with deep brain stimulation. In patients undergoing bilateral procedures deep brain stimulation of the thalamus is the procedure of choice to avoid adverse effects seen with bilateral ablative procedures. The use of medication and/or surgery can provide adequate tremor control in the majority of the patients.","Adrenergic Agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Electric Stimulation Therapy, Essential Tremor/*drug therapy/physiopathology/surgery, Humans, Neuromuscular Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Primidone/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Risk Assessment",-1

Oral baclofen improves cerebral spasticity mildly, but its activity is limited because of its poor lipid solubility. Cerebrospinal fluid baclofen levels after intrathecal administration are many times higher than those achieved after oral administration. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion has been used to treat cerebral spasticity in two patient groups: in older ambulatory children with inadequate underlying leg strength, and in patients with severe spasticity in both the upper and lower extremities. Responsiveness to intrathecal baclofen is confirmed by test injections before insertion of a programmable subcutaneous pump. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion dosages vary from 27 to 800 micrograms/day. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion reduces spasticity in the upper and lower extremities, and improves upper extremity function and activities of daily living but has no effect on athetosis in the dosages used to treat spasticity. Complications related to the intrathecal catheter occur in approximately 20% of patients, and infection requiring pump removal occurs in approximately 5%. Preliminary studies indicate that continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion alleviates some forms of generalized dystonia associated with cerebral palsy.","Administration, Oral, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/*complications, Drug Tolerance, Humans, Infusion Pumps/economics, Injections, Spinal, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Receptors, GABA-B/drug effects, Spine/drug effects/physiopathology",-1

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this brief review is to compare the effects of clonidine on walking capabilities in SCI subjects with functionally complete and incomplete spinal cord injuries. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Both oral administration and intrathecal injection of clonidine were investigated. A motorized treadmill was used and harness support provided in most of the SCI subjects as no walking capabilities could be observed overground. A single subject design was used in these chronic SCI subjects. SETTING: Canada and France. RESULTS: In complete SCI subjects while receiving clonidine, none of the subjects was able to initiate independent stepping. In contrast, the greatest effects were found in SCI subjects with injuries that are incomplete but still severely disabling while minimal effects could be observed in the more functional SCI subjects. These effects on walking are observed in measures of walking speed, and electromyographic and kinematic patterns. Regardless of effects on walking, however, a consistent decrease of the flexor reflex amplitude could be observed in all SCI subjects independent of the severity of the lesion. CONCLUSION: This review demonstrated that clonidine could be a powerful anti-spasmodic drug in addition to improving locomotion in a limited number of SCI subjects. The mechanism, significance and implications of these results will be discussed.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Animals, Clonidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Electromyography/methods, Humans, Motor Activity/drug effects/physiology, Norepinephrine/physiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*drug therapy, Walking/*physiology",-1

Adverse events are generally mild, including (for caspofungin) local phlebitis, fever, abnormal liver function tests, and mild haemolysis. Poor absorption after oral administration limits use to the intravenous route. Dosing is once daily and drug interactions are few. The echinocandins are widely distributed in the body, and are metabolised by the liver. Results of studies of caspofungin in candidaemia and invasive candidiasis suggest equivalent efficacy to amphotericin B, with substantially fewer toxic effects.

METHODS: Fourteen rapid cycling bipolar patients were treated with quetiapine, which was added to their ongoing medication regimen for 112 +/- 33 days. At the beginning of the study, five were manic, three were in a mixed state, three were depressed, two hypomanic and one was euthymic. Patients were assessed prospectively with a modified version of the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Bipolars (CGI-BP), the Young Scale for mania (YMRS) and the Hamilton Scale for Depression (HDRS). RESULTS: A significant reduction of the following scale scores was observed: a 1.8 point reduction for the general CGI-BP (p = 0.013), a -1.3 point for the mania subscale (p = 0.016), a -1.01 point for the YMRS (p = 0.025). Improvement in depressive symptoms was not significant, neither in the CGI-BP (-1 point, p = 0.074) nor in the HDRS (-5.2 points, p = NS). The most common side-effect was sedation (n = 6, 43%). Doses of quetiapine were significantly reduced by the end of the study (443 +/- 235 mg/day versus 268 +/- 190 mg/day, p = 0.008) and they also differed according to the initial episode to be treated (720 +/- 84 mg/day for mania, and 183 +/- 29 mg/day for depression, p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Quetiapine could possibly be an effective treatment for rapid cycling bipolar patients.

Some of these patients may be prescribed opiates initially which may result in requiring progressively higher doses for pain relief. In this clinical setting, the suspicion of narcotic bowel syndrome should be borne in mind. With appropriate treatment and counselling, further invasive investigations including laparotomy may be avoided and resolution of symptoms can be achieved with clonidine. This case report demonstrates such a typical clinical scenario and discusses the possible aetiology and pathophysiology of narcotic bowel syndrome as well as the role of clonidine in controlling opiate withdrawal symptoms.","Abdominal Pain/*chemically induced, Adult, Analgesics, Opioid/*adverse effects, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*drug therapy, Syndrome",-1

METHOD: Open and controlled studies, case reports, and case series on the efficacy of lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, tiagabine, and zonisamide were located through electronic searches of several databases, by manual search of proceedings of international meetings, and through contacting authors of recent reports. RESULTS: Lamotrigine is the best studied anticonvulsant and has efficacy in acute bipolar depression and in longer term treatment of bipolar depression as well as rapid-cycling bipolar II disorder but not in acute mania. Open reports suggest usefulness of gabapentin as an adjunct in bipolar disorder, but double-blind trials failed to confirm efficacy in acute mania and treatment-resistant rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Topiramate is reported to be effective in acute mania and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder in several open studies, but methodological problems in a double-blind study led to a failed study in acute mania. However, topiramate may lead to weight loss in some patients. Zonisamide deserves further investigation, but tiagabine does not appear to be useful in acute mania. CONCLUSION: Lamotrigine clearly fills an unmet need in treating bipolar depression and rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Other third generation anticonvulsants with the exception of tiagabine offer promise but require confirmation of their efficacy from double-blind studies.","Acetates/therapeutic use, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Fructose/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Humans, Isoxazoles/therapeutic use, Nipecotic Acids/therapeutic use, Placebos, Treatment Outcome, Triazines/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
7746750,Treatment of acquired muscle spasticity using phenol peripheral nerve blocks.,"Botte MJ, Abrams RA, Bodine-Fowler SC",Orthopedics. 1995 Feb;18(2):151-9.,"The use of phenol motor nerve blocks is advantageous in the early period of acquired spasticity (ie, that occurring following traumatic brain injury or incomplete spinal cord injury), when increased muscle tone is often the most severe. Because acquired spasticity is dynamic and usually improves slowly, a temporary treatment method used to ameliorate increased muscle tone is desirable. Phenol nerve infiltration provides a temporary motor nerve block that lasts for weeks or months. It allows passive limb mobilization in a comprehensive rehabilitation program that attempts to prevent fixed soft tissue contractures. Permanent or irreversible methods such as operative tendon lengthening, muscle release or recession, or neurectomy are usually best delayed until the spasticity has become static, when the need for surgical correction becomes more firmly indicated, and outcomes of operative intervention are more predictable. Although phenol nerve blocks were initially administered at the spinal cord level to control spasticity, the potential side effects have caused a loss of popularity of this method of administration. The safer and more common use of phenol infiltration at the peripheral nerve level is now more accepted for brain injury and spinal cord injury patients. This report reviews the indications, current concepts, and development of the different methods used to administer phenol nerve blocks. Comparisons to other methods to control spasticity are discussed.","Animals, *Autonomic Nerve Block/instrumentation/methods, Brain Injuries/complications/rehabilitation, Contracture/etiology/*prevention & control, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/etiology/*therapy, Neural Conduction/drug effects, Phenol, *Phenols, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/rehabilitation",-1

Judiciously applied, it can reduce local muscle overactivity while maintaining the strength in other muscles. To date BTX has not been licensed for use in spasticity in the UK and the literature pertaining to clinical practice is still relatively scant. However, controlled trials have provided evidence of the effectiveness of BTX both in reducing spasticity itself and in achieving functional gain.

Other organ involvement, including renal failure, neurologic abnormalities, and gastrointestinal symptoms, is common. Adverse reactions to drugs increasingly are reported as a potential cause of TTP-HUS. More than 50 drugs and other substances have been associated with the development of TTP-HUS, but many case reports are difficult to interpret because there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of TTP-HUS and because there is uncertainty regarding the relation of drug exposure to the onset of TTP-HUS. A systematic analysis of reports of drug-associated TTP-HUS will be required to better understand the strength of clinical evidence linking drugs to the etiology of TTP-HUS. In this review, five drugs that have been the subject of the most and the most recent reports of drug-associated TTP-HUS are discussed: mitomycin C, cyclosporine, quinine, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel. The clinical features of TTP-HUS associated with these drugs are different, suggesting two principal mechanisms by which drugs may cause TTP-HUS: dose-related toxicity (mitomycin C, cyclosporine), and immune-mediated reaction (quinine, ticlopidine, clopidogrel). The role of plasma exchange is uncertain, but this treatment is appropriate because of the high mortality and morbidity of drug-associated TTP-HUS. Recognition of a drug-associated etiology in a patient with TTP-HUS is critical to avoid re-exposure and recurrent illness.","Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects, Cyclosporine/adverse effects, Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/*chemically induced/diagnosis, Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects, Mitomycin/adverse effects, Muscle Relaxants, Central/adverse effects, Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/adverse effects, Quinine/adverse effects, Ticlopidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives",-1

In a previous pilot study of quadriplegic patients, 75% of whom were treated with baclofen, we found a high prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing. Because of the depressant effects of GABA on the central nervous system, we hypothesized that baclofen might aggravate sleep-disordered breathing in susceptible individuals by depressing central ventilatory drive, increasing upper airway obstruction and/or increasing the arousal threshold to apnoea. We therefore conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study of baclofen 25 mg, administered before sleep in 10 snorers with mild sleep-disordered breathing (respiratory disturbance index < 30 events per sleep hour). Each subject underwent two standard polysomnographic assessments, one week apart. Total sleep time was significantly prolonged by baclofen (placebo 356 +/- 9.9 SEM min; baclofen 386 +/- 9.9 min). Both nonrapid eye movement(REM) and REM sleep duration were increased (nonREM: placebo 295 +/- 6.8 min; baclofen 311 +/- 8.9 min; REM: placebo 61 +/- 7.5 min; baclofen 76 +/- 9.0 min). Time spent awake after sleep onset was reduced after baclofen (placebo 71 +/- 10.3 min; baclofen 51 +/- 9.7 min). There was a slight reduction in mean overnight oxygen saturation (placebo 95.2 +/- 0.5%; baclofen 94.4 +/- 0.7%).

Although oral medications do a fair job of controlling spasticity in most patients, some patients will need additional forms of treatment. In many cases, oral medications alone do not adequately control spasticity or the patient cannot tolerate the side effects. In these instances, botulinum toxin may help control the spasticity for approximately 3 months after injection. The amount of botulinum toxin and the injection sites can be tailored to meet individual patient needs. Botulinum toxins can reduce spasticity, improve function, and reduce the amount of needed assistance.","Anti-Dyskinesia Agents/*therapeutic use, Botulinum Toxins/*therapeutic use, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/*drug therapy/surgery",-1

Because of the potential for central nervous system side effects, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-period crossover study evaluated the effects of 2.5 and 5 mg doses of zolmitriptan on psychomotor performance and investigated any pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interaction with diazepam. Twelve healthy volunteers received the following ""treatments"" as single doses: zolmitriptan 2.5 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 2.5 mg + diazepam 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg + diazepam 10 mg and placebo. Pre-dose and at 1, 4, 8, and 24 h post-dose, the following validated battery of psychomotor tests was performed: Bond-Lader visual analogue scales (calmness, contentedness, and alertness factors), critical flicker fusion test, choice reaction time (recognition, motor, and total reaction times), finger-tapping test, number cancellation test and digit symbol substitution test. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, its active metabolite, and diazepam and its active metabolites were measured at the same timepoints. Zolmitriptan 2.5 and 5 mg had no effect on psychomotor function when given alone. In contrast, diazepam 10 mg had profound effects, consistent with its sedative properties, but there was no synergism on concomitant administration of either dose of zolmitriptan. Plasma concentrations of zolmitriptan, diazepam, and their respective active metabolites were similar when the two drugs were given alone or in combination.","Adult, Cross-Over Studies, Diazepam/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Oxazoles/blood/*therapeutic use, *Oxazolidinones, Psychometrics, Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects, Reference Values, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/blood/*therapeutic use, Tryptamines",-1
8625113,"Progress in reducing nausea and emesis. Comparisons of ondansetron (Zofran), granisetron (Kytril), and tropisetron (Navoban).","Morrow GR, Hickok JT, Rosenthal SN",Cancer. 1995 Aug 1;76(3):343-57.,"BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting are the most distressing side effects associated with the administration of chemotherapy for neoplastic diseases. Nausea, in particular, often had been ignored in studies of chemotherapy side effects. Recently, progress has been made in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, due, in part, to a better understanding of the physiologic mechanisms involved. METHODS: This paper reviews recent advances in the control of emesis, focusing on pharmacologic treatments. RESULTS: The efficacy and safety of the serotonin (5-HT3) receptor antagonists granisetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron in the control of acute and delayed emesis and emesis induced by repeat-cycle chemotherapy are summarized. Although differences in study design and definitions of response criteria have made it difficult to compare the studies that have evaluated these three agents, the overall body of literature supports several clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The 5HT3 antiemetic agents have been shown to be clinically more effective in the control of nausea and emesis than previously used agents. (2) No one of the three has demonstrated consistently greater efficacy. (3) Efficacy appears to be more pronounced for cisplatin-containing regimens than for moderate or less emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. (4) Effectiveness of the 5HT3 agents appears to be less for delayed nausea and emesis than for acute symptoms. Potential control of anticipatory nausea and emesis has not been investigated. (5) Control over nausea appears to be significantly less than control over emesis. In the studies in which it has been measured, nausea control remains incomplete for approximately half the patients given 5HT3 agents. (6) The efficacy of the agents appears to diminish across repeated days and, perhaps, across repeated chemotherapy cycles. (7) The addition of a steroid such as dexamethasone increases the efficacy of both 5HT3 and other antiemetic agents. This effect also seems to apply to delayed nausea and emesis.","Antiemetics/*therapeutic use, Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects, Granisetron/therapeutic use, Humans, Indoles/therapeutic use, Nausea/chemically induced/*drug therapy, Ondansetron/therapeutic use, Serotonin Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Vomiting/chemically induced/*drug therapy",-1

8527012,CNS adverse events associated with antimalarial agents. Fact or fiction?,"Phillips-Howard PA, ter Kuile FO",Drug Saf. 1995 Jun;12(6):370-83.,"CNS adverse drug events are dramatic, and case reports have influenced clinical opinion on the use of antimalarials. Malaria also causes CNS symptoms, thus establishing causality is difficult. CNS events are associated with the quinoline and artemisinin derivatives. Chloroquine, once considered too toxic for humans, has been the antimalarial of choice for 40 years. While a range of serious CNS effects have been documented during chloroquine therapy, the incidence is unclear (extrapyramidal symptoms occur with an incidence of 1 in 5000). Amodiaquine has a higher incidence of mild CNS effects than chloroquine. Mefloquine therapy causes dose-related transient dizziness. Serious CNS events during mefloquine therapy occur in 1:1200 Asians and 1:200 Caucasians/Africans. Risk factors include dosage, concomitant drug use/interactions, previous history of a CNS event and disease severity. Retreatment (within a month) increases the risk in Asians 7-fold. Studies indicate that the frequency of serious CNS events with mefloquine prophylaxis (1:10,000) is similar to that with chloroquine (1:13,600). Quinine causes cinchonism at standard therapeutic doses. High-tone hearing loss occurs, but irreversible auditory or ocular effects are very rare. The artemisinin derivatives are associated with dose-dependent brain lesions in rodent, canine and nonhuman primates. At low doses, histological injury has been demonstrated, without clinical neurological signs. No significant toxicity has been reported in humans. Other antimalarial drugs are seldom associated with CNS adverse events. Data do not suggest a need to diminish the correct use of the quinoline derivatives. Irreversible effects are extremely rare and usually associated with overdosing or prior history of a serious CNS event. Concomitant therapeutic use of 2 drugs from the same family, or retreatment with the same drug, should be avoided. Onset of drug-associated serious CNS events requires drug discontinuation and future avoidance of the drug.","Adult, Animals, Antimalarials/*adverse effects/classification, Central Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced, Child, Dogs, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Guidelines as Topic, Humans, Malaria/drug therapy/physiopathology, Primates, Psychoses, Substance-Induced/etiology, Rodentia",-1
8527013,A risk-benefit assessment of cisapride in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.,"Tack J, Coremans G, Janssens J",Drug Saf. 1995 Jun;12(6):384-92.,"Cisapride is a substituted benzamide compound that stimulates motor activity in all segments of the gastrointestinal tract by enhancing the release of acetylcholine from the enteric nervous system. Cisapride is administered orally in the treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndromes and chronic constipation. In gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in both adults and children, cisapride provides symptomatic improvement and mucosal healing. Long term treatment with cisapride is effective in the prevention of relapse of oesophagitis. Cisapride improves gastric emptying rates and improves symptoms in patients with gastroparesis of various origins. Unlike domperidone and metoclopramide, long term administration of cisapride seems to result in persistently enhanced gastric emptying. Cisapride is also effective in improving symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia. In comparative studies in patients with functional dyspepsia, cisapride was at least as effective as metoclopramide, domperidone, clebopride, ranitidine and cimetidine. Cisapride increases stool frequency and reduces laxative consumption in patients with idiopathic constipation. Severe cases of slow transit constipation seem refractory to cisapride. Clinical studies also indicate that cisapride might be effective in the treatment of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, postoperative ileus, peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. Further clinical studies are warranted to define the role of cisapride in these conditions. The dosage of cisapride ranges from 5mg 3 times daily to 20mg twice daily. Cisapride is generally well tolerated, both during short and long term treatment. In children, cisapride is also well tolerated in doses of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg, 3 to 4 times daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Anti-Ulcer Agents/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Cisapride, Gastric Emptying/drug effects, Gastrointestinal Diseases/*drug therapy, Gastrointestinal Motility/drug effects, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Piperidines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Serotonin Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use",-1

Current research focuses more on specific stroke treatment, such as reperfusion or prevention of extension of ischaemic brain damage, than on the management of general conditions and the treatment of medical complications associated with acute stroke. At present, a better prognosis of stroke is more often the consequence of good general management than of a specific therapy. General management of stroke includes cardiac and pulmonary care, fluid and ion balance restoration, metabolic maintenance, blood pressure control and prevention of bed sores and phlebitis. Treatment of elevated intracranial pressure and temperature control must also be considered in some cases. Several points, however, remain controversial, such as the treatment of arterial hypertension and the management of cardiac arrhythmia.","Acute Disease, Brain/blood supply/pathology, Brain Ischemia/epidemiology/pathology/therapy, Cerebrovascular Circulation, Cerebrovascular Disorders/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy, Humans, Prognosis",-1

To enhance its effectiveness, an additional electrical stimulation seems promising. Most patients tolerate the neurolytic agent well.

BACKGROUND: Behavioral treatments often are used alone or adjunctively for different types of headache. There are, however, only a few studies that have compared the efficacy and durability of the same treatment in different types of primary headache, and the effects of treatment on headache-related drug consumption rarely have been assessed even in these studies. METHODS: Twenty-five women with primary headache (11 with mixed headache, 8 with migraine, and 6 with tension-type headache) were evaluated via an open-label, self-controlled, 8-month, follow-up study design. After an initial 4 months of observation, patients began learning Schultz-type autogenic training as modified for patients with headache. They practiced autogenic training on a regular basis for 4 months. Based on data from headache diaries and daily medication records, headache frequencies and the amounts of analgesics, ""migraine-specific"" drugs (ergots and triptans), and anxiolytics taken by the patients were compared in the three subgroups over the 8-month period. Results.-From the first month of implementation of autogenic training, headache frequencies were significantly reduced in patients with tension-type and mixed headache. Significant reduction in frequency was achieved in patients with migraine only from the third month of autogenic training. Decreases in headache frequencies were accompanied by decreases in consumption of migraine drugs and analgesics resulting in significant correlations among these parameters. Reduction in consumption of anxiolytic drugs was more rapid and robust in patients with tension-type headache compared to patients with migraine, and this outcome failed to show any correlation with change in headache frequency. CONCLUSION: Schultz-type autogenic training is an effective therapeutic approach that may lead to a reduction in both headache frequency and the use of headache medication.","Adolescent, Adult, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, *Autogenic Training, Behavior Therapy/methods, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/complications/drug therapy/*therapy, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/*therapeutic use, Sumatriptan/*therapeutic use, Tension-Type Headache/complications/drug therapy/*therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

The psychosis commonly appears following a lucid interval, ranging from a few hours to days after seizure termination. An underlying structural brain abnormality is common and usually involves the temporal lobe. Postictal psychosis, while well known in adults, has not been described previously in children. We describe a 9-year-old boy with right hemiparesis due to a neonatal stroke, who developed a postictal schizophrenia-like psychosis following status epilepticus. Electroencephalography showed left-sided slowing. A brain computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging revealed left hemisphere hypoplasia. A 99mTc-ECD single photon emission computed tomographic scan of the brain revealed decreased left-hemisphere perfusion, most pronounced to the medial temporal lobe. The psychosis resolved gradually over 7 days without antipsychotic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of postictal psychosis in a child.","Child, Cysteine/analogs & derivatives/diagnostic use, Electroencephalography, Functional Laterality, Humans, Male, Organotechnetium Compounds/diagnostic use, Psychotic Disorders/*etiology/psychology, Radiopharmaceuticals/diagnostic use, Status Epilepticus/*complications/*psychology, Tomography, Emission-Computed",-1
12495648,A paradoxical effect of levetiracetam may be seen in both children and adults with refractory epilepsy.,"Nakken KO, Eriksson AS, Lossius R, Johannessen SI",Seizure. 2003 Jan;12(1):42-6.,"The aim of this prospective, uncontrolled clinical study was to evaluate the tolerability and the efficacy of levetiracetam as add-on treatment in 78 adults and 44 children with intractable epilepsy. The patients' seizure frequency in the 8 weeks baseline period was compared to their seizure frequency after a mean follow-up of 8 months of treatment.A greater than 50% reduction in seizure frequency was achieved in 31 adults (40%) and 9 children (20%), of whom 7 adults (9%) and 3 children (7%) became seizure free. Most often levetiracetam was well tolerated, somnolence being the most frequently reported side effect (18% in adults and 7% in children). However, in 14 adults (18%) and 19 children (43%) levetiracetam was associated with an increase (>25%) in seizure frequency. Such a paradoxical effect, including the development of status epilepticus in three adults and four children, appeared most often in mentally retarded patients during the first 2 months of treatment, and on relatively high doses. Two children developed status epilepticus after 5 and 7 months, respectively. In conclusion, levetiracetam is usually well tolerated as add-on treatment in patients with difficult-to-treat partial onset seizures. By using a lower initial dose and a slower dose escalation than recommended by the manufacturer, a paradoxical effect may perhaps be avoided. In children, doses >20 mgkg(-1) per day should be introduced with caution.","Adolescent, Adult, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Drug Resistance, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Piracetam/administration & dosage/*analogs &, derivatives/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Prospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1

Other countries in which kava pyrones have been used as anxiolytics, namely GB and the USA, have not followed suit. Kava pyrone anxiolytics have been positively reviewed by the Cochrane Collaboration; also newer German clinical studies have indicated pharmacological anxiolysis at the recommended doses. To use the first choice of treatment, psychotherapy, for all uncomplicated cases of pathological fear does not appear to be realistic. Current data about kava pyrone toxicity are unclear. Judging from the few well documented cases of kava pyrone hepatotoxicity (appr. 2 out of 36) in Germany and Switzerland, an immunologically mediated idiosyncratic mechanism appears to be most likely, especially at higher doses, whereas a direct toxic mechanism is much less likely. No direct results are available for the incidence of kava pyrone-related adverse drug effects. From spontaneously reported cases the incidences of adverse drug reactions cannot be obtained, a rough estimation indicates the incidence of hepatotoxicity to be comparable to those of benzodiazepines. Taken together, the withdrawal of kava pyrone-based anxiolytics appears to be an ill founded over-reaction given the lack of superior therapeutic alternatives. Neither the case evaluations presented by the BfArM (Bundesamt fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte = Federal Office for Drugs and Medical Products) nor the complete rejection of proof for therapeutic efficacy of kava pyrone anxiolytics are scientifically well founded.","Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*toxicity, Drug Interactions, Drug-Induced Liver Injury/etiology, Germany, Humans, *Kava, *Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts/*toxicity, Pyrones/toxicity, United States",-1

The aims of this study were to assess the timing and type of SE in stroke patients and to observe the effects of stroke and the type of SE on the response to treatment and mortality. From May 1998 to May 2001 a total of 121 patients were admitted with SE. Among these, 30 cases (24.8%) of poststroke SE were identified and evaluated. There were 20 early-onset, and 10 late-onset SE. All stroke types were evenly distributed within the early-onset group, whereas only ischaemic stroke was found in the late-onset group. Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) infarcts were significantly more common within the latter (P: 0.0017). Nonconvulsive SE (NCS) was more frequent than convulsive SE (CS) in the early-onset group (P: 0.0352). There was a delay in the time-to-treatment for NCS compared to CS (P: 0.0007). Without, however any effect on the rate of response to first step treatment (intravenous diazepam and phenytoin; P: 0.6334). Thirteen patients died (43.3%) during hospitalisation. Disability was significantly associated with higher mortality in the early-onset group (P: 0.0201). As a conclusion, NCS seems to be an important issue in stroke, thus requiring a high degree of suspicion in an acute stroke setting to avoid further neuronal injury and morbidity.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Data Collection, Female, Hospitals, University, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Prognosis, Status Epilepticus/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology, Stroke/*complications/pathology, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1

However, antinociceptive doses of intrathecal clonidine may produce pronounced hemodynamic side effects, including hypotension and bradycardia. In this report, we present a case of severe hypotension after cardiopulmonary bypass in a patient with intrathecal clonidine infusion. We postulate that the intrathecally administered alpha 2-agonist clonidine reduced our patient's ability to tolerate the hemodynamic lability that is present during the separation from cardiopulmonary bypass by potentially inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity, renin-angiotensin system, or vasopressin release.

Patients were randomly put on gabapentin (19 males and 8 females) or lamotrigine (6 males and 19 females) as add on therapy. The efficacy of the drugs was assessed by the seizure frequency, pattern of seizures and seizure free interval. The safety was evaluated from the biochemical investigations and the adverse effects observed or reported by the patients during the course of the study. The average frequency of basal partial seizures was 6.26+3.86 and 5.04+2.47 which decreased significantly (p<. 001) after 12 weeks of add on therapy to 1.75+2.16. and 1.68+2.94 in the GBP and LTG group respectively. However, there was no significant difference between the two drugs after 12 weeks of add on therapy. The PCB (primary change in basal seizure frequency) values decreased to -72+34.92 and -76.22+29.68 in the GBP and LTG group respectively. The difference in these two groups was not significant. The responder rate was 77.7% and 92% respectively in GBP and LTG group respectively. GBP was found to be more effective in partial seizures with secondarily generalization while LTG was effective in all subtypes of partial seizures. The abnormal scalp EEG was recorded in 33.3% (9 of 27 patients) in GBP group and 40 %( 10 of 25 patients) in LTG group and it did not revert to normal in 33.3% and 40% of patients in either of groups (GBP/LTG).

The combination of morphine and clonidine produced significantly more pain relief than placebo 4 h after administration; either morphine or clonidine alone did not produce as much pain relief. In addition, lumbar and cervical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations, sampled at these levels at different times after administration were examined for a relationship between pain relief and CSF drug concentration. Lumbar CSF drug concentrations were initially several orders of magnitude larger than those in cervical CSF. After 1-2 h, the concentrations of morphine in cervical CSF markedly exceeded those of clonidine. The concentration of morphine in the cervical CSF and the degree of pain relief correlated significantly. We conclude that intrathecal administration of a mixture of clonidine and morphine is more effective than either drug administered alone and is related to the CSF-borne drug concentration above the level of spinal cord injury. If there is pathology that may restrict CSF flow, consideration should be given to intrathecal administration above the level of spinal cord damage to provide an adequate drug concentration in this region.","Adult, Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Clonidine/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Female, Heart Rate/drug effects, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Morphine/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacology, Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, Sympatholytics/administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid/*therapeutic use",-1

Newer antiepileptics, including gabapentin and topiramate, are being evaluated for their role in preventive therapy. The mechanism of action of antiepileptics is not fully understood, but they all share a common role in enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition.

The self-injurious behavior in these two subjects and a very young child responded to treatment with anticonvulsants. The self-injurious behavior in the fourth patient was probably the result of poor technique of using his mouth to move his hands, which responded to conservative management including education, occupational therapy and gloves.

DESIGN: All patients with traumatic-onset spinal cord injury treated with gabapentin were identified and followed up using a longitudinal observational design with two contact points (6 and 36 months after the trial) using a semi-structured interview. The first follow-up interview attempted to capture all 31 patients placed on therapeutic trial. The second follow-up interview attempted to capture those reporting a favorable response (n = 14) to the therapeutic trial at the first follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 27 patients contacted at the first follow-up (87% response rate), 6 (22%) discontinued the trial secondary to intolerable side effects; therefore, the pain analgesic effects of gabapentin in these patients could not be determined. Of the remaining 21 patients, 14 (67%) reported a favorable response (i.e., a 2 or greater point reduction on a 0-10 pain-rating scale). The second follow-up interview captured 11 (79% response rate) of the 14 patients reporting a favorable response at the first interview, and 91% (10 of 11 patients) continued to report that gabapentin was an effective analgesic. There was no evidence to suggest dosing difficulties due to tolerance over the 3-year period. Sedation, dizziness, and forgetfulness were the most common side effects.

INTERVENTIONS: Extent of exposure, incidence of drug-related adverse events, serious adverse events and study withdrawals were examined. RESULTS: The median duration of exposure for lamotrigine monotherapy and add-on therapy was 24.1 and 47.4 weeks, respectively. The median daily dosage of lamotrigine was 100 mg for monotherapy (range 75 to 500 mg) and 300 mg for add-on therapy (range 25 to 700 mg).

The initiating trauma affects primarily the extremity, but can also be a central lesion (e.g., spinal cord injury, stroke). CRPS is clinically characterized by sensory, autonomic and motor disturbances. Pathophysiologically there is evidence for functional changes within the central nervous system and for involvement of peripheral inflammatory processes. The sympathetic nervous system plays a key role in maintaining pain and autonomic dysfunction in the affected extremity. After a primary central lesion, secondary peripheral changes in the paretic extremity are suggested to be important in initiating a CRPS.

Average (SE) time to pain was 318 (23) days for patients in the placebo group and 324 (24) days for patients in the amitriptyline group. CONCLUSIONS: With the achieved sample sizes of this study and a pain rate of approximately 21% in the placebo group, any near-perfect pain protection would have been detected. Near-perfect pain protection, in this context, refers to pain in <2.4% of the recruited patients treated with amitriptyline or in approximately 89% of placebo-treated patients. Larger studies are recommended to test the hypothesis that prophylactic amitriptyline reduces but does not completely prevent central poststroke pain.","Acute Disease, Adult, Aged, Amitriptyline/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Delayed-Action Preparations/therapeutic use, Demography, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Fatigue/chemically induced, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Likelihood Functions, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/etiology/physiopathology/*prevention & control, Pain Measurement/drug effects, Pilot Projects, Sample Size, Stroke/*complications/physiopathology, Thalamus/blood supply/physiopathology, Time, Treatment Outcome, Xerostomia/chemically induced",-1

Ninety-eight patients aged 18-70 years with more than six muscle cramps in two weeks were enrolled. A two-week run-in period without treatment was followed by two weeks of treatment with 400 mg quinine or placebo per day and a wash-out period of two weeks without treatment. The primary outcome measure was the reduction in the number of muscle cramps between the run-in and treatment periods. The intensity of cramps, number of nights with cramps, sleep disturbance and intensity of pain were recorded as secondary outcome measures. At baseline the median number of cramps was 12 in two weeks in both groups. The median reduction between the run-in and therapy phases was eight (95% CI 7-10) versus six (95% CI 3-7) muscle cramps during quinine and placebo treatment; 36 (80%) participants in the quinine group and 26 (53%) in the placebo group had a reduction of at least 50% in the number of muscle cramps. Frequency, intensity and pain at night showed a statistically significant difference in favour of quinine. The improvement was more evident according to physician assessment than patient assessment; this is corroborated by the high placebo response rate. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to side-effects. Short term treatment with 400 mg quinine per day can effectively prevent nocturnal leg cramps in adults without relevant side-effects.","Adult, Aged, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Quinine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Statistics, Nonparametric, Tinnitus/chemically induced, Treatment Outcome, Vomiting/chemically induced",-1

Epub 2002 Apr 13.,"The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of intrathecal baclofen therapy delivered by a programmable pump for the chronic treatment of spinal spasticity. Twelve patients with intractable spasticity caused by spinal cord injuries underwent implantation of a programmable continuous infusion pump after significant reduction in spasticity following an intrathecal test bolus of baclofen. No deaths or new permanent neurological deficits occurred following surgery or chronic intrathecal baclofen therapy. The follow-up (12 months) shows a reduction in rigidity in the lower limb of 2.0 points on the Ashworth scale and in the upper limb of 1.2 points. Muscle spasms were reduced from a mean preoperative score of 2.8 to a mean postoperative score of 1.0. In two cases, we observed postoperative catheter dislocation, a complication which could be corrected surgically. This study demonstrates that chronic intrathecal baclofen infusion is a safe and effective form of treatment of intractable spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury. There is considerable reduction in the risk of infection in view of the fact that interrogation and programming of the implanted programmed pumps is noninvasive.","Baclofen/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Catheterization/adverse effects, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Humans, Infusion Pumps/adverse effects, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic, use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications",-1
7655132,Propantheline bromide in the management of hyperhidrosis associated with spinal cord injury.,"Canaday BR, Stanford RH",Ann Pharmacother. 1995 May;29(5):489-92.,"OBJECTIVE: To report 2 cases in which oral propantheline reduced the discomfort associated with sweating related to spinal cord injury (SCI), and to review the literature on the management of SCI-related sweating. CASE SUMMARIES: Case 1: A 27-year-old quadriplegic man with an American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Frankel class C injury to C5/C6 experienced profuse sweating and requested propantheline. He stated that he had received the medication previously and reported that propantheline 15 mg tid had controlled his sweating. Propantheline bromide was reinstituted, and within 24 hours, the patient's episodes of profuse sweating had decreased markedly in number and frequency. Case 2: A 35-year-old quadriplegic woman had an ASIA class D lesion at C3. Since her injury, she had experienced profuse sweating that worsened when she became cold and at night. She stated that her sweating was under control as long as she took propantheline. Propantheline therapy was continued and no further sweating episodes have occurred. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was used to identify pertinent literature including reviews. Standard texts and texts referenced in the pertinent literature also were examined. STUDY SELECTION: All available sources of information were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: The earliest case reports of systemic therapy for hyperhidrosis described the use of the anticholinergic methantheline bromide. Methantheline in combination with ergoloid mesylates also was suggested for the treatment of congenital hyperhidrosis. Local topical therapy for hyperhidrosis, such as aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride, the active ingredients in some antiperspirants, have been tried with some success. Talc, starch, and other powders have been suggested to absorb excessive sweat. Formalin and glutaraldehyde also have been used. Topical propantheline bromide has been used successfully in treating palmar and plantar hidrosis. Clonazepam has been used successfully in a case of unilateral localized hyperhidrosis. Systemic phenoxybenzamine has been used with some success and there have been attempt at other systemic therapy using mecamylamine, atropine, propoxyphenel, and methenamine. Scopolamine patches also have been used successfully in a small number of patients. Other agents that have been used include dibenamine, piperoxan, and phentolamine. Systemic propantheline also has been listed as an agent with potential efficacy in treating the profuse sweating associated with SCI, but was not recommended primarily because of adverse effects and difficulty in titrating to the lowest effective dosage. However, studies or case reports specific to the use of propantheline in patients with SCI appear to be lacking, as are reports of direct comparison between propantheline and other agents. DISCUSSION: Concerning the mechanism of action of propantheline bromide for hyperhidrosis, it seems reasonable to attribute its effects to the drug's well-documented anticholinergic/antimuscarinic actions. At dosages used to effectively treat neurogenic bladder, propantheline bromide also should block the muscarinic receptors responsible for sweat gland stimulation. Central nervous system adverse effects should be minimal at usual clinical dosages, as propantheline does not cross the blood-brain barrier. CONCLUSIONS: It would appear that in some patients with SCI who are subject to incidental episodes of profuse sweating, oral propantheline may offer some relief and may, in fact, be well tolerated, as in the cases described. Additionally, propantheline would seem a good therapeutic choice in SCI patients with excessive sweating and neurogenic bladder dysfunction who may derive dual benefit from the agent.","Adult, Female, HIV Seropositivity/complications, Humans, Hyperhidrosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Male, Propantheline/*therapeutic use, Quadriplegia/etiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic/etiology",-1

We selected patients that required at least two successive increments of morphine to maintain pain relief. A possible pharmacokinetic interaction between nimodipine and morphine was also studied in 14 patients by assaying steady-state serum levels of morphine and its 3- and 6-glucuronides. A total of 30 patients completed the study, 14 and 16 in the nimodipine and placebo groups, respectively. Nimodipine controlled the escalation of the morphine dose in 9 patients (65%), and placebo in 4 (28%), the difference being statistically significant (P=0.03). The dose of morphine was reduced from 313+/-52 to 174+/-33 mg/day (P < 0.001) in the nimodipine group, and from 254+/-26 to 218+/-19 mg/day (not significant) in the placebo group. The percentages of reduction in the daily dose of morphine also showed significant differences between both groups (P=0.02). One week after introducing nimodipine or placebo, while the dose of morphine remained similar to that of the pre-test week, the serum levels of morphine and its glucuronides were not modified significantly. We conclude that the introduction of nimodipine in patients chronically treated with morphine may be a safe alternative to reduce the daily requirements of the opioid. It is suggested that interference with Ca2+-related events may attenuate the development and/or expression of tolerance to morphine in a clinically relevant way.","Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Biotransformation, Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Synergism, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Neoplasms/*complications, Nimodipine/*therapeutic use, Pain, Intractable/*drug therapy/etiology/psychology",-1
7655137,Rapid infusion of amphotericin B in dextrose.,"Gales MA, Gales BJ",Ann Pharmacother. 1995 May;29(5):523-9.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the data examining the use of rapid infusion of amphotericin B in dextrose infusions. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of the English-language literature and review of pertinent references' bibliographies was used to identify articles evaluating the effect of amphotericin B infusion rates on the incidence of adverse reactions. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Controlled and uncontrolled studies involving humans are reviewed; emphasis is placed on recent comparative trials. Pertinent information, as judged by the authors, was selected for discussion. DATA SYNTHESIS: Amphotericin B, a polyene antifungal agent with significant toxicity, remains the agent of choice for many serious fungal infections. The potential benefits of rapid administration of amphotericin B in reducing the incidence and/or severity of adverse reactions were noted soon after its introduction. Recent studies have examined the tolerability of rapid (0.75-1 h) amphotericin B infusions. Results of studies assessing the tolerability of rapid amphotericin B infusions suggest that tolerance to infusion-related reactions develops during therapy. Comparative trials have obtained variable results. The comparative trials supporting rapid amphotericin B infusion have generally used crossover designs, enrolled small numbers of patients, and excluded patients with significant renal or cardiovascular dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid amphotericin B infusions should be avoided during initiation of therapy when infusion-related reactions tend to be most problematic, and in patients with cardiovascular disease, renal dysfunction, and potassium disorders because of the potential risk for cardiac arrhythmias. The literature currently available is conflicting and insufficient to support the routine use of rapid amphotericin B infusion.","Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/chemistry, Clinical Trials as Topic/classification, Drug Tolerance, Female, Glucose/administration & dosage, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous/adverse effects, Male, Time Factors",-1

Such cramps are associated with many common diseases and medications. Physiological methods may be useful for preventing cramps in some people, but there have been no controlled trials of these approaches. Quinine is moderately effective in preventing nocturnal leg cramps. However, there are concerns about the risk/benefit ratio with this drug. In patients with severe symptoms, a trial of 4-6 weeks' treatment with quinine is probably still justified, but the efficacy of treatment should be monitored, for example using a sleep and cramp diary.","Aged, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Leg, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Nafronyl/therapeutic use, Quinine/therapeutic use, Sleep Disorders/etiology, Vasodilator Agents/therapeutic use",-1

We investigated hydroquinine therapy in otherwise healthy adults who had frequent, ordinary muscle cramps. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial consisted of three consecutive 2-week periods: qualification, treatment, and washout, 68 women and 44 men who had at least three muscle cramps per week were enrolled. During the treatment period, participants were randomly assigned 300 mg daily dose of hydroquinine hydrobromide dihydrate (54 participants) or placebo (58). The frequency, severity (1-10), duration, and location of muscle cramps, as well as any side-effects, were recorded by participant in daily diaries. The primary outcome measures were the number of muscle cramps and the number of days during which the participants had muscle cramps (cramp-days). FINDINGS: We excluded five participants from both groups from the analysis. Thus, data from 49 hydroquinine-group participants and 53 placebo-group participants were analysed. In both groups the total number of muscle cramps and the number of cramp-days decreased during the treatment period compared with the qualification period. However, these improvements were greater in the hydroquinine group than in the placebo group. The hydroquinine-group participants reported a median of 8 (95% CI 7-12) fewer cramps and median of 3 (1-4) fewer cramp-days, whereas those on placebo reported only 3 (0-5) fewer cramps and 1 (0-5) fewer cramp-days. 32 (65%) of participants in the hydroquinine group had a 50% or greater reduction in the number of muscle cramps. After the onset of cramps, hydroquinine did not reduce the severity or duration of cramps. We also found a sustained effect after treatment had stopped. Hydroquinine was well tolerated, and resulted in only mild side-effects. INTERPRETATION: In our study, 300 mg hydroquinine was safe to take in the short-term and significantly more effective than placebo in the prevention of frequent, ordinary muscle cramps. This therapeutic effect outlasted the duration of treatment.","Administration, Oral, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Double-Blind Method, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Parasympatholytics/*therapeutic use, Quinidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Tablets, Treatment Outcome",1
11018227,Bipolar depression: pharmacotherapy and related therapeutic strategies.,"Thase ME, Sachs GS",Biol Psychiatry. 2000 Sep 15;48(6):558-72.,"The depressed phase of bipolar affective disorder is a significant cause of suffering, disability, and mortality and represents a major challenge to treating clinicians. This article first briefly reviews the phenomenology and clinical correlates of bipolar depression and then focuses on the major pharmacological treatment options. We strongly recommend use of mood stabilizers as the first-line treatment for the type I form of bipolar depression, largely because longer-term preventative therapy with these agents almost certainly will be indicated. Depressive episodes that do not respond to lithium, divalproex, or another mood stabilizer, or episodes that ""breakthrough"" despite preventive treatment, often warrant treatment with an antidepressant or electroconvulsive therapy. The necessity of mood stabilizers in the type II form of bipolar depression is less certain, aside from the rapid cycling presentation. Both experts and practicing clinicians recommend bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as coequal initial choices, with venlafaxine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as tranylcypromine, preferred for more resistant cases. The risk of antidepressant-induced hypomania or mania with concomitant mood stabilizer therapy is low, on the order of 5% to 10% during acute phase therapy. Additional therapeutic options and optimal durations of therapy also are discussed.","Acute Disease, Algorithms, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Depression/*drug therapy/etiology, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1

OBJECTIVES: To describe the rationale and design of the SPORT project and to discuss its strengths and limitations. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive. METHODS: First, the authors explain the rationale for embarking on SPORT, i.e., deficiencies in the existing scientific knowledge base for treatment of these conditions. Second, the authors describe the design of SPORT, including topics such as specific aims, participating sites, study population, recruitment and enrollment, study interventions, follow-up, outcomes, statistical analysis, and study governance and organization. Finally, issues that complicate the performance of randomized trials in surgery as they relate to the design and conduct of SPORT are discussed. RESULTS: The SPORT project is being conducted at 11 clinical centers around the United States. It involves the simultaneous conduct of three multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials. The study includes patients with the three most common diagnoses for which spine surgery is performed: intervertebral disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and degenerative spondylolisthesis, and it compares the most commonly used standard surgical and nonsurgical treatments for patients with these diagnoses. By the end of enrollment the authors anticipate a total of 500 patients with intervertebral disc herniation, 370 patients with spinal stenosis, and 300 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis in the randomized trials. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria but decline to be randomized are invited to participate in an observational cohort study. Patients are being followed for a minimum of 24 months with visits scheduled at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

12901598,Rational design of peptide vaccines for autoimmune disease: harnessing molecular recognition to fix a broken network.,"Weathington NM, Blalock JE",Expert Rev Vaccines. 2003 Feb;2(1):61-73.,"Autoreactive T-cells and antibodies are found at low levels in normal individuals and are thought to be kept at bay by regulatory T-cells and a network of idiotypic and anti-idiotype-bearing antigen receptors on lymphocytes as well as idiotypic anti-idiotypic antibodies. Disruption of this network by genetic, environmental and unknown factors is thought to result in autoimmune diseases. An obvious, ideal and specific therapy for such disorders would be to harness this regulatory network to re-establish immunologic homeostasis. In practice, however, this is not an easy task as most autoimmune diseases involve polyclonal responses to self antigen. Thus, we are faced with the conundrum of not knowing which autoreactive idiotype-bearing antibody or antigen receptor(s) to target in order to restore or induce network regulatory function. The thesis of this review is that understanding a fundamental property governing peptide/protein shape can be used in part to circumvent the problems of self reactivity and polyclonality in autoimmune disorders. More specifically, an algorithm has been developed to design peptide vaccines with shapes that are thought to be complementary in contour to self epitopes which seem to be the focus of autoimmunity. In theory, such complementary shapes should be engendered in certain autoreactive antigen receptors--these complementary constructs consequently represent receptor mimetics. By targeting an immune response against such mimetics, one generates a polyclonal anti-idiotype response that matches the complexity of the autoimmune response itself. This article will describe the algorithm for vaccine design, summarize the in vitro and in vivo evidence for its efficacy and discuss possible therapeutic utility in human autoimmune diseases.","Algorithms, Amino Acid Motifs, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*biosynthesis/chemistry/immunology, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Autoantibodies/chemistry/immunology, Autoantigens/*chemistry/immunology, Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/*therapy, Epitopes/*chemistry/immunology, Guillain-Barre Syndrome/immunology/therapy, Humans, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*chemistry/immunology, *Immunotherapy, Active, Molecular Mimicry, Molecular Sequence Data, Multiple Sclerosis/immunology/therapy, Myasthenia Gravis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology/therapy, *Protein Conformation, Protein Folding, Rats, Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/immunology, Vaccines, Subunit/*chemistry/immunology",-1
11318882,An open-label dose-titration study of the efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine hydrochloride tablets in the prophylaxis of chronic daily headache.,"Saper JR, Winner PK, Lake AE 3rd",Headache. 2001 Apr;41(4):357-68.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess effectiveness and safety of tizanidine hydrochloride tablets for the prophylaxis of chronic daily headache. BACKGROUND: Tizanidine hydrochloride is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release and effectiveness of norepinephrine at both central sites (eg, the locus ceruleus) and the spinal cord. It acts as a central muscle relaxant and has antinociceptive effects. Preliminary research and retrospective analyses have suggested efficacy in treatment of both chronic tension-type headache and chronic daily headache with migrainous features. DESIGN: Thirty-nine patients with more than 15 headache days per month (33 with migraine, 5 migrainous, 1 chronic tension-type) completed a 4-week baseline, with 31 completing a planned 12 weeks of treatment with tizanidine. Dosing was titrated from 2 mg at bedtime to a median daily dose of 14 mg (mean, 13.5; SD, 4.3; range, 4 to 20, divided over three doses per day) by treatment week 4. RESULTS: The overall headache index through week 12 (headache frequency x average intensity x duration) declined significantly (P<.00000002), with a corresponding increase in mean percentage improvement from 49% for weeks 1 through 4, to 65% for weeks 5 through 8, and 64% for weeks 9 through 12 (P<.0182). During weeks 9 through 12, 67% had improved more than 50% compared to baseline. Overall headache frequency declined from 22.83 to 15.83 days per month (P<.00001), with frequency of severe headaches dropping from 7.52 to 3.58 days per month (P<.000035). Average headache intensity dropped from 1.83 to 1.07 (1-to-5 scale), peak intensity declined from 2.37 to 1.40, and mean duration was reduced from 6.96 to 4.00 hours per headache (P<.00001). Improvement also occurred on visual analog scales of overall headache status, mood, sleep, quality of life (P<.00001), and sexual function (P<.0075); as well as the Beck Depression Inventory-II (P<.00073). Mild-to-moderate adverse events reported by more than 10% of the patients included somnolence, asthenia, and dry mouth. Only 3 patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events: somnolence and dry mouth alone (n = 1), or in combination with either hyperkinesis (n = 1) or constipation (n = 1). One patient had elevated liver enzymes that returned to normal after the drug was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide preliminary support for the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tizanidine in the prophylaxis of chronic daily headache.","Adolescent, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Clonidine/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Headache Disorders/classification/*prevention & control, Humans, Male, Medical Records, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, Prospective Studies, Treatment Outcome",1

The reported prevalence of chronic SCI pain is variable but averages 65% with around one third of these people rating their pain as severe. The mechanisms responsible for the presence of pain are poorly understood. However, evidence from clinical observations and the use of animal models of SCI pain suggests that a number of processes may be important. These include functional and structural plastic changes in the central nervous system following injury, with changes in receptor function and loss of normal inhibition resulting in an increased neuronal excitability. A number of specific types of SCI pain can be distinguished based on descriptors, location and response to treatment. Nociceptive pain can arise from musculoskeletal structures and viscera and neuropathic pain can arise from spinal cord and nerve damage. The role of psychological and environmental factors also needs to be considered. Accurate identification of these pain types will help in selecting appropriate treatment approaches. Current treatments employ a variety of pharmacological, surgical, physical and psychological approaches. However, evidence for many of the treatments in use is still limited. It is hoped that future research will identify effective treatment strategies that accurately target specific mechanisms.","Chronic Disease, Humans, Pain/*diagnosis/*etiology/physiopathology, Pain Management, Palliative Care/*methods, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, Syndrome",-1
12966259,"A pilot study examining topical amitriptyline, ketamine, and a combination of both in the treatment of neuropathic pain.","Lynch ME, Clark AJ, Sawynok J",Clin J Pain. 2003 Sep-Oct;19(5):323-8.,"OBJECTIVE: The involvement of ongoing peripheral activity in the generation of nociceptive input in neuropathic pain suggests that topical drug delivery may be useful as a treatment strategy. This is a pilot study providing initial information regarding the use of novel topical preparations containing amitriptyline (AMI), ketamine (KET), and a combination of both in the treatment of neuropathic pain. METHODS: The study design included a 2 day randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 4 way cross-over trial of all treatments, followed by an open label treatment phase using the combination cream for 7 days. Twenty volunteers with chronic neuropathic pain were randomly assigned to treatment order and applied 5 mls of each topical treatment (1% AMI, 0.5% KET, combination AMI 1%/KET 0.5%, and placebo) for 2 days. Measures of pain at the end of each block included the short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) and visual analog scales (VAS) for present pain intensity and pain relief. Eleven subjects who judged subjective improvement from any treatment in the initial trial entered the open-label trial and used the combination cream for 7 days. Pain levels were recorded daily using the same measures. Blood levels for amitriptyline and ketamine were performed at 7 days to determine whether systemic absorption had occurred. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference from placebo after 2 days for any treatment during the double blind component of the trial. In the 11 subjects who used the combination cream, there was a statistically significant effect, with subjects reporting significantly greater analgesia by days 3 to 7 according to measures of pain and pain relief. Blood levels revealed that there was no significant systemic absorption of amitriptyline or ketamine. Only 2 subjects experienced side effects; these were minor and did not lead to discontinuation of the cream. CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated a lack of effect for all treatments in the 2 day double blind placebo controlled trial, followed by analgesia in an open label trial in a subgroup of subjects who chose to use the combination cream for 7 days. Blood analysis revealed no significant systemic absorption of either agent after 7 days of treatment, and creams were well tolerated. A larger scale randomized trial over a longer interval is warranted to examine further effects observed in the open label trial.","Administration, Topical, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Amitriptyline/*administration & dosage, Chronic Disease, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Drug Combinations, Female, Humans, Ketamine/*administration & dosage, Male, Middle Aged, Nervous System Diseases/*complications/drug therapy, Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology, Pain Measurement/methods, Pilot Projects, Placebos, Treatment Outcome",-1

11485613,Clinical and functional outcome after alcohol neurolysis of the tibial nerve for ankle-foot spasticity.,"Chua KS, Kong KH",Brain Inj. 2001 Aug;15(8):733-9.,"PURPOSE: To report one's experience of using 50-100% alcohol for neurolysis of the tibial nerve in chronic ankle-foot spasticity. METHODS: The records of patients who received alcohol neurolysis of the tibial nerve were retrospectively reviewed. Repetitive monopolar nerve stimulation was used to localize the tibial nerve. Outcome measures included muscle tone as measured by the Modified Ashworth Score (MAS), passive ankle range of motion (PROM), effect on clonus, plantar flexor motor strength, visual gait analysis and use of orthoses. RESULTS: A total of 21 tibial nerves were neurolysed in 18 patients (mean age 38.9 +/- 15.8 years, 12 males, six females). Mean duration post-event was 14.8 +/- 3.9 months. The mean pre-neurolysis MAS was 2.50 +/- 0.77 and this improved to 0.97 +/- 0.88 (p < 0.001) and 0.93 +/- 0.85 (p < 0.001) at 1 and 6 months post-procedure, respectively. Average duration of effect was 10.5 +/- 8.9 months. Eleven out of 12 patients (91.7%) with sustained ankle clonus had complete abolishment lasting 6 months. Mean gain in PROM was 24.6 +/- 16.1 degrees and 32.6 +/- 19.0 degrees at 1 and 3 months post-neurolysis, respectively (p < 0.001, < 0.02). No decrease in motor strength was seen post-neurolysis. All 13 ambulant patients had visible improvements in gait. Complications were transient and included dysesthetic pain (4), sensory loss (1) and distal limb oedema (1). CONCLUSION: Alcohol neurolysis (50-100%) of the tibial nerves is an effective and safe method of managing ankle-foot spasticity.","Adolescent, Adult, Ankle/*innervation, Ethanol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Foot/*innervation, Humans, Injections, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Retrospective Studies, Tibial Nerve/*drug effects, Treatment Outcome",-1

Patients present with a variety of symptoms, including urinary obstruction, fever, myalgias, decreased libido or impotence, painful ejaculation and low-back and perineal pain. Physical examination often fails to clarify the cause of the pain. Cultures and microscopic examination of urine and prostatic secretions before and after prostatic massage may help differentiate prostatitis caused by infection from prostatitis with other causes. Because the rate of occult infection is high, a therapeutic trial of antibiotics is often in order even when patients do not appear to have bacterial prostatitis. If the patient responds to therapy, antibiotics are continued for at least three to four weeks, although some men require treatment for several months. A patient who does not respond might be evaluated for chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, in which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, alpha-blocking agents, anticholinergic agents or other therapies may provide symptomatic relief.","Abscess/diagnosis, Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Humans, Male, Pelvic Pain/etiology, Prostatic Diseases/diagnosis, Prostatitis/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/microbiology",-1

METHODS: The authors performed a prospective cohort study of 898 patients 65 years or older who presented to an urban academic ED in 1995 and 1996. Seventy-nine percent of the patients were African-American and 43% did not graduate from high school. Potentially inappropriate medications and adverse drug-disease interactions were identified using the 1997 Beers explicit criteria for elders. During the three months after the initial visit, revisits to the ED or hospital, death, and changes in health-related quality of life were analyzed as measured by validated questions adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study. RESULTS: Upon presentation, 10.6% of the patients were taking a potentially inappropriate medication, 3.6% were given one in the ED, and 5.6% were prescribed one upon discharge from the ED. The most frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate medications in the ED were diphenhydramine, indomethacin, meperidine, and cyclobenzaprine. Emergency physicians added potentially inappropriate medications most often to patients with discharge diagnoses of musculoskeletal disorder, back pain, gout, and allergy or urticaria. Potentially adverse drug-disease interactions were relatively uncommon at presentation (5.2%), in the ED (0.6%), and on discharge from the ED (1.2%). Potentially inappropriate medications and adverse drug-disease interactions prescribed in the ED were not associated with higher rates of revisit to the ED, hospitalization, or death, but were correlated with worse physical function and pain. However, confidence intervals were wide for analyses of revisits and death. CONCLUSIONS: Suboptimal medication selection was fairly common and was associated with worse patient-reported health-related quality of life.","Accidental Falls/prevention & control/statistics & numerical data, Aged, Cardiovascular Diseases/complications/drug therapy, Chicago, Cohort Studies, Diabetes Complications, Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy, Drug Interactions, Drug Utilization Review/*standards/statistics & numerical data/trends, Emergency Service, Hospital/*standards/statistics & numerical data, Female, Hospitals, University, Humans, Incidence, Longitudinal Studies, Male, Medication Errors/*statistics & numerical data, Peptic Ulcer/complications/drug therapy, Prospective Studies, Quality of Health Care, Quality of Life, Respiratory Tract Diseases/complications/drug therapy, Risk Assessment, Urban Population, Wounds and Injuries/*complications",-1

DESIGN: A nationwide cross-sectional survey of office visits by the elderly. SETTING: The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) 1992, a national probability sample survey of office visits by ambulatory patients within the continental US. SUBJECTS: A national probability sample of patients 65 years or older visiting office-based physicians. National estimates are based on the National Center for Health Statistics weighting procedure for the NAMCS sample. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of 20 inappropriate medications that should be entirely avoided in the elderly, using criteria developed by a panel of national experts in geriatric medicine and geriatric pharmacology. RESULTS: In the US during 1992, an estimated 8.47 million (95% CI 7.66 million to 9.28 million) office visits by the elderly indicated prescribing of at least 1 of the 20 inappropriate medications. Approximately 7.75 million (95% CI 6.98 million to 8.52 million) visits by the elderly involved 1 inappropriate medication and 0.72 million (95% CI 0.51 million to 0.93 million) visits included 2 inappropriate medications. According to the NAMCS, office-based physicians prescribed at least 1 inappropriate medication to 7.58% of the elderly who received prescriptions. The most frequently prescribed inappropriate medications were propoxyphene, amitriptyline, dipyridamole, diazepam, and chlorpropamide. Elderly patients rarely received prescriptions from office-based physicians for drugs such as secobarbital, isoxsuprine, trimethobenzamide, and carisoprodol. Furthermore, office-based physicians did not prescribe cyclandelate, pentobarbital, or phenylbutazone for the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: The prescribing of inappropriate medications by office-based physicians raises concerns regarding the quality of care for the elderly in ambulatory settings. The crux of improving patient care in ambulatory settings rests with collaborative efforts between physicians and pharmacists.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Ambulatory Care/*standards, Cross-Sectional Studies, *Drug Prescriptions, Drug Therapy/contraindications/statistics & numerical data, Drug Utilization/standards/*statistics & numerical data, Humans, Physician's Practice Patterns/*statistics & numerical data, Quality of Health Care, Quality of Life, Statistics, Nonparametric, United States",-1

DESIGN: Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4-week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention-to-treat. SETTING: Two specialist, out-patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8-day withdrawal episode, participants could self-select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling). MEASUREMENTS: Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Withdrawal severity; adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. FINDINGS: The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P = 0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3-8) and day 35 (62% versus 39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4-18); used heroin on fewer days during the withdrawal programme (2.6 +/- 2.5 versus 4.5 +/- 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1-2.5 days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 +/- 8.2 versus 14.6 +/- 10, P < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.8-9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse events reported. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is effective for short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment retention than symptomatic medications.","Adult, Ambulatory Care/methods, Buprenorphine/*therapeutic use, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Female, Heroin Dependence/*rehabilitation, Humans, Male, Narcotics/*therapeutic use, Patient Compliance, Substance Abuse Treatment Centers, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*prevention & control, Sympatholytics/therapeutic use",-1

Her serum level of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) was markedly elevated and continuous muscular activities were observed on resting surface EMG. These features were compatible with those in stiff-person syndrome (SPS). She was found to have thymoma on CT scan. Immediately after thymomectomy, which was histologically diagnosed as a benign hyperplasia, she developed head retraction reflex-like movements evoked by sensory stimulation to the face, which were followed by severe bulbar symptoms with dysphagia and respiratory arrest. Postoperative myasthenia gravis was excluded clinically. While somatosensory evoked EMG on splenius muscle initially showed biphasic responses with latency of 15 msec and 55 msec, respectively after oral angle non-painful electric stimulation, the late potential phase disappeared after the patient recovered from bulbar symptoms. This suggests that head retraction reflex-like movements of this patient reflected the attenuation of inhibitory potentials from the brainstem.","Autoantibodies/blood, Biological Markers/blood, Brain Stem/physiopathology, Dantrolene/therapeutic use, Deglutition Disorders/etiology, Dyspnea/*etiology, Female, Glutamate Decarboxylase/immunology, *Head Movements, Humans, Middle Aged, *Reflex, Stiff-Person Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Thymus Hyperplasia/complications",-1
9477149,High dose gabapentin in refractory partial epilepsy: clinical observations in 50 patients.,"Wilson EA, Sills GJ, Forrest G, Brodie MJ",Epilepsy Res. 1998 Jan;29(2):161-6.,"Fifty patients with refractory partial seizures took part in a prospective, observational study of adjuvant gabapentin (GBP) in increasing doses. Thirty-three were started on 400 mg GBP daily with further weekly increments of 400 mg until seizures came under control for at least 6 months or to the limit of tolerability. A further 17 patients, not fully controlled on low dose GBP, followed the same regimen. All patients took the drug three times daily. Comparisons were made with seizure numbers during a 3-month baseline during which antiepileptic medication remained unchanged. Overall, 24 of the 50 patients documented a seizure reduction of 50% or more. Fifteen did so at or below 2400 mg GBP daily. Three of these patients became seizure-free. The remaining nine appeared to respond to higher daily doses of GBP (1:2800 mg; 3:3600 mg; 1:4000 mg; 1:4800 mg; 3:6000 mg), with two becoming seizure-free. Side-effects most commonly reported included tiredness, dizziness, headache and diplopia. On GBP doses exceeding 3600 mg daily, three patients developed flatulence and diarrhoea and two more had myoclonic jerks. Mean circulating GBP concentrations (mg/l) at each 1200 mg dose level were as follows: 1200 mg-4.1; 2400 mg-8.6; 3600 mg 13.2; 4800 mg 15.5; 6000 mg-17.2. In six patients, including three taking 6000 mg daily, GBP concentrations continued to rise linearly at each dosage increment. Although limited, our results do not support the suggestion that GBP absorption is saturable. High dose GBP may be effective in controlling seizures in patients with refractory partial epilepsy.","Acetates/administration & dosage/blood/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Diarrhea/chemically induced, Diplopia/chemically induced, Dizziness/chemically induced, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Epilepsies, Myoclonic/chemically induced, Epilepsies, Partial/*drug therapy, Fatigue/chemically induced, Female, Flatulence/chemically induced, Headache/chemically induced, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Seizures/drug therapy, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

The management of patients with fibromyalgia is thus mostly based on empirical research, and only a few controlled studies have been performed. Basic drug therapy rests on the administration of amitriptyline and conventional analgesics. Such therapy should be initiated only after careful patient information and delineation of therapeutic goals are provided. Any drug therapy should be administered in combination with physical treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy. Because of the appearing contours of pathogenic mechanisms, hopefully a number of new drugs will be available to the patients with this complex pain syndrome in the near future.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Behavior Therapy, Biofeedback, Psychology, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Fibromyalgia/drug therapy/therapy, Humans, Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation",-1

This open-label trial was conducted at research sites in South Africa during the main malaria transmission season, February through July. The study volunteers were temporarily living in, or traveling to, a malaria-endemic area. They received I tablet of 250 mg atovaquone and 100 mg proguanil hydrochloride once daily for up to 10 weeks. Subjects were monitored using sequential clinical and laboratory assessments. Thick blood smears were stained and evaluated by a central laboratory. An immunochromatographic test for P. falciparum was also used for on-site patient management. Prophylactic success was summarized using a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects who did not develop parasitemia or who withdrew due to a treatment-related adverse event. A total of 175 subjects (15% women) were enrolled in the trial. The mean duration of drug exposure was 8.9 weeks. The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride was well tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events considered possibly related to study treatment were headache (7%), abdominal pain (2%), increased cough (2%), and skin disorder (2%). No serious adverse events were reported, and no treatment-emergent effects were noted for any laboratory variables. One subject who was noncompliant with therapy developed parasitemia, and 3 subjects withdrew due to a treatment-related adverse event (2 subjects with headache and 1 with nausea and dizziness). The prophylaxis success rate was 97%. In this study, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride combination therapy had an excellent safety and efficacy profile for prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria in nonimmune subjects.","Adult, Antimalarials/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Atovaquone, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum/*prevention & control, Male, Middle Aged, Naphthoquinones/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Proguanil/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, South Africa",-1
11402494,Pantoprazole.,Poole P,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2001 Jun 1;58(11):999-1008.,"The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage and administration of pantoprazole are reviewed. Pantoprazole is a gastric hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K(+)-ATPase) inhibitor. It shares the same core structure as other currently available proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). The FDA-labeled indication is the short-term treatment of erosive esophagitis. PPIs act by selectively inhibiting H+/K(+)-ATPase in the secretory canaliculus of the stimulated parietal cell. Understanding the pharmacodynamics of PPIs is more relevant than knowing their pharmacokinetics, since the duration of action depends on the rate of de novo proton-pump regeneration, not the duration of drug circulation in the body. Pantoprazole is well absorbed, undergoes little first-pass metabolism, and has an absolute bioavailability of approximately 77%. Pantoprazole has been evaluated in more than 100 clinical trials involving more than 11,000 patients. It is effective in treating erosive esophagitis and duodenal and gastric ulcers. It is also effective as adjunctive treatment with antimicrobials in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori. Pantoprazole has been shown to control acid production in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Pantoprazole is well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse effects are headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The recommended oral dosage for erosive esophagitis is 40 mg once a day for up to eight weeks. The recommended i.v. dose is 40 mg given over 15 minutes once a day in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are unable to take oral medication. Pantoprazole appears to be as safe and effective as other PPIs in acid-related disorders.","2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles, Anti-Ulcer Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Benzimidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Esophagitis/*drug therapy/etiology, Gastroesophageal Reflux/complications/*drug therapy, Humans, Omeprazole/analogs & derivatives, *Proton Pump Inhibitors, Sulfoxides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use",-1

INTERVENTIONS: A collaborative service delivery model, involving a preliminary case conference, a home visit and a second case conference, was agreed through discussions with medical and pharmacy organisations and then implemented. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medication-related problems; actions recommended; actions implemented; and outcomes after actions taken. RESULTS: Overall, 2764 problems were identified. The most common medication-related problem (17.5% of all problems) was the need for additional tests. Thirty-seven per cent of problems related to medicine selection, 20% to patient knowledge, and 17% to the medication regimen. Of 2764 actions recommended to resolve medication-related problems, 42% were implemented. Of the 978 problems for which action was taken and follow-up data were available, 81% were reported to be ""resolved"", ""well managed"" or ""improving"".

The long persistence of this disorder led to a search for the cause which was eventually traced to medication with dapsone. The latter was found to be inappropriately being taken by the patient instead of an antispasmodic that had been prescribed for a spinal condition; this was because the tablets had been incorrectly labelled and dispensed in a pharmacy. The patient took increasing doses of the presumed 'antispasmodic' tablets as they seemed to lack clinical effect, thus further exacerbating the toxic consequences. Moreover, the patient brought his wrongly labelled tablets into hospital and was allowed to use them there, contrary to normal hospital policy. As treatment for the methaemoglobinaemia both bolus and continuous infusions of methylene blue were used, which probably contributed to the severe haemolysis which followed. Furthermore, the development of a rare side effect of dapsone toxicity, namely that of a sensorimotor neuropathy, is reported.","Adult, Antidotes/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Baclofen/therapeutic use, Dapsone/blood/*poisoning, *Exchange Transfusion, Whole Blood, Folic Acid Antagonists/blood/*poisoning, Hemolysis/drug effects, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous, Injections, Intravenous, Male, Medication Errors, Methemoglobinemia/*chemically induced, Methylene Blue/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy, Muscle Weakness/chemically induced, Paraplegia/chemically induced, Paresthesia/chemically induced",-1

DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University department of cardiothoracic anesthesia. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty patients scheduled for off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery using the Octopus 2 stabilizer system. INTERVENTIONS: Isoproterenol, 4 microg, was administered intravenously after induction of anesthesia and again after surgery to monitor cardiac beta-receptor function. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol and cardiovascular variables were monitored before, during, and after immobilization of the target coronary artery with catheters in the radial and pulmonary arteries. During surgery on the left anterior descending artery (n = 23), stroke volume and cardiac index decreased 17 mL (21%) and 400 mL (17%). During revascularization of the circumflex artery (n = 9), stroke volume and cardiac index decreased 19 mL (28%) and 300 mL (17%). During surgery on the posterior aspect of the heart (n = 13), stroke volume and cardiac index decreased 22 mL (29%) and 400 mL (17%). All the cardiovascular variables had returned to baseline values 5 minutes after releasing the heart. The hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol were equal before and after surgery. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the hemodynamic changes associated with off-pump surgery on the 3 major coronary arteries are similar and of short duration. No desensitization of cardiovascular beta-adrenoceptors was found. This finding is in contrast to the deterioration in beta-adrenoceptor function seen after surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.","Adrenergic beta-Agonists/administration & dosage, Adult, Aged, Cardiac Output, Cardiopulmonary Bypass, *Coronary Artery Bypass, Female, *Hemodynamics/drug effects, Humans, Isoproterenol/administration & dosage, Male, Middle Aged, Myocardium/*metabolism, Prospective Studies, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/*metabolism, Stroke Volume",-1
8800627,Dose-related adverse effects of anticonvulsants.,Troupin AS,Drug Saf. 1996 May;14(5):299-328.,"The serum concentration at which a given drug has full efficacy in delivering seizure control bears no predictable relationship to the concentration at which adverse effects will appear. In theory, the threshold for adverse effects should be considerably higher than that for efficacy. For each agent this obviously happens most of the time, or the anticonvulsant would not be on the market, but there are also patients in whom this relationship is reversed. The adverse effects of this class of drugs are discussed from three points of view: the adverse effect type, the kinetic factors that so frequently determine the presence of adverse effects, and the specific characteristics of each drug. Some less well recognized adverse effects syndromes that are not strictly dose related are considered. The importance of adverse effects in therapeutic monitoring is then addressed, and some strategies for maximising efficacy without the burden of long term functional impairment or distress are discussed. The usefulness of monotherapy is stressed with due attention to rational choice of second drugs, when necessary, based on mechanisms of antiepileptic action and adverse effects profiles. While most of these symptoms evolve gradually, there are times when acute, drastic, and even life threatening clinical overdose situations present themselves. Special attention is given to these scenarios, drawing on the drug profiles and clinical pharmacokinetics that define these events to propose methods of coping with the problems efficiently and effectively.","Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/poisoning, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Humans",-1

Patients (n=108) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed episode requiring treatment with an antipsychotic were recruited. All subjects were on one or two mood stabilizers at the time of initiation of risperidone (range 0.5-4 mg). No other antipsychotic medication or ongoing benzodiazepine therapy was allowed. There was a significant decrease in mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) scores from baseline (27.5+/-7.5) to week 1 (-10.8, P<0.0001), week 3 (-17.7, P<0.0001) and to week 12(-22.6, P<0.0001). When response was defined as > or = 50% reduction in YMRS scores from baseline, 32%, 68% and 90% of patients met criteria at week 1, week 3 and week 12, respectively. Significant decreases in mean 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores from baseline (12.2+/-7.7) to week 3 (-5.7, P<0.0001) and week 12 (-5.7, P<0.0001) were also observed. No significant changes in extrapyramidal symptoms were noted between baseline and endpoint. The mean daily dose of risperidone was 2 mg with a median of 1.8 mg. These findings support the results of the two previous double-blind, randomized trials and indicate that the addition of risperidone to mood stabilizers is a safe and effective treatment for acute and continuation treatment of mania. Risperidone add-on does not induce depressive symptoms and, furthermore, risperidone may have efficacy in treating comorbid depressive symptoms in bipolar patients.","Adult, Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Carbamazepine/therapeutic use, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Lithium Compounds/therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Risperidone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Time Factors, Valproic Acid/therapeutic use",-1
12715017,Overuse of symptomatic medications among chronic (transformed) migraine patients: profile of drug consumption.,Krymchantowski AV,Arq Neuropsiquiatr. 2003 Mar;61(1):43-7. Epub 2003 Apr 16.,"Chronic daily headache and chronic (transformed) migraine (TM) patients represent more than one third of the subjects seen in specialized headache centers. Most of these patients may overuse symptomatic medications (SM) taken on a daily basis to relieve headache and associated symptoms. The conversion to the daily or near-daily pattern of headache presentation is thought to be related to the medication overuse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile of SM consumption among transformed migraine patients attending a tertiary center. One hundred thirty three consecutive patients (22 men and 111 women, ages 17 to 80) with TM and overuse of SM according to the proposed criteria of Silberstein et al (1994, 1996) were prospectively studied. None of the patients were under treatment for other conditions. Among them, 73 (54.9%) were using one category of SM, while 55 (41.3%) and 5 (3.8%) patients were taking simultaneously two and three categories of SM respectively. The categories of overused symptomatic medications varied from simple analgesics to narcotics, triptans and combinations of ergot derivatives and caffeine and of analgesics and caffeine. The average intake per patient per day was of 3 to 4 tablets and mostly of the patients overused simple analgesics (isolated or in combination with other substances) (75.2%), caffeine containing drugs (71.4%), drugs containing ergotamine derivatives (26.1%), triptans (alone or combined) (15.5%), drugs with narcotics or ansiolitics (13%) and anti-inflammatory drugs (3.7%). The mechanisms by which the overuse of symptomatic medications may play a role in this transformation are uncertain but despite of the necessity of controlled trials to demonstrate the real role of such compounds in the development of transformed migraine, this study emphasizes the necessity for more rigorous prescribing guidelines for patients with frequent headaches.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Analgesics/*adverse effects, Brazil/epidemiology, Chronic Disease, Combined Modality Therapy, Drug Prescriptions, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/*chemically induced/epidemiology, Prospective Studies, Retrospective Studies, Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology",-1

Central pain can be controlled either by opposing glutamate neurotransmission or potentiating GABAergic transmission. It is speculated that a relative hypofunction of the GABAergic inhibition both at thalamic and cortical levels leads to a sectorial excitatory hypertonus in those same areas.

Myoclonus is also a developmental feature of the human nervous system, comprising some of the earliest fetal movements. In pathologic settings, myoclonus may be the only neurologic abnormality, as in essential myoclonus, but more often it is one symptom of a larger neurologic problem. The vast etiologic spectrum of symptomatic myoclonus can be bewildering, but defining the underlying problem may provide the opportunity to develop specific therapies. Otherwise, treatment is merely symptomatic. The approach to the patient should be to verify the nature of the movement disorder and establish a specific etiologic diagnosis. A battery of neurophysiologic, neuroradiologic, and other laboratory studies is needed to localize the origin of the myoclonus and identify causative lesions. Drug treatment is largely empiric but must be systematic and aimed at restoring activities of everyday living. Unlike in epilepsies, in myoclonus multiple drugs usually must be combined to attain functional improvement.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Ataxia/diagnosis, Autoimmune Diseases/diagnosis, Child, Disease Models, Animal, Epilepsy/diagnosis, Humans, *Myoclonus/diagnosis/etiology/therapy, Neurotoxicity Syndromes/diagnosis",-1
8730971,Comparison of the effects of clonidine on tyramine- and methoxamine-evoked mydriasis in man.,"Bitsios P, Langley RW, Szabadi E, Bradshaw CM",Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1996 Apr;41(4):269-75.,"1. It has been reported previously that clonidine can potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis on the pain-free side of cluster headache patients. We examined whether a single oral dose of clonidine (200 micrograms) can also potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis in healthy subjects, using mydriasis to methoxamine, a directly acting sympathomimetic amine, as a control. 2. Eight healthy male volunteers participated in four weekly sessions. In the first two sessions (Experiment 1) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to tyramine hydrochloride eyedrops (75 mM; 2 x 10 microliters), and in the last two sessions (Experiment 2) the effect of clonidine or placebo on the mydriasis to methoxamine hydrochloride eyedrops (20 mM; 2 x 10 microliters) was examined. In both experiments subjects were allocated to drugs and sessions according to a double-blind balanced design. In both experiments, pupil diameter of both the treated and the untreated eyes was recorded in standard ambient light and in the dark, before, and 2 h after clonidine/placebo, via binocular infrared television pupillometry. Salivation (dental roll technique), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sitting), heart rate, and self-ratings of mood and feelings (visual analogue scales), were also measured before, and 2 h after the ingestion of clonidine or placebo. 3. Both tyramine and methoxamine produced a significant mydriasis, which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: tyramine/light 1.05 +/- 0.28; tyramine/dark: 0.73 +/- 0.15; methoxamine/light: 1.65 +/- 0.28; methoxamine/dark: 0.85 +/- 0.15). Clonidine produced a significant miosis in the untreated eye which was more prominent in the light condition (change in resting pupil size; mm +/- s.e.mean: Experiment 1, light: -1.34 +/- 0.19; Experiment 1, dark: -0.46 +/- 0.1; Experiment 2, light -0.97 +/- 0.18; Experiment 2, dark: -0.29 +/- 0.17). Clonidine had no significant effect on either tyramine- or methoxamine-evoked mydriasis. 4. In agreement with previous reports, clonidine significantly reduced salivation (g, mean +/- s.e.mean; Experiment 1: -0.84 +/- 0.22; Experiment 2: -0.55 +/- 0.11), systolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 1: -17.5 +/- 3.76; Experiment 2: -23.38 +/- 4.67), diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg; Experiment 2: -12.38 +/- 2.05), alertness (mm; Experiment 2: -24.19 +/- 5.40), and anxiety (mm; Experiment 1: -13.82 +/- 4.60), indicating the presence of pharmacodynamically effective tissue levels of the drug. 5. These results show that a single oral dose (200 micrograms) of clonidine causes significant miosis in human subjects, and fails to potentiate tyramine-evoked mydriasis. This indicates that the pupil on the asymptomatic side of cluster headache patients is affected differently from the pupils of healthy volunteers by tyramine and/or clonidine.","Adolescent, Adult, Clonidine/*pharmacology, Humans, Male, Methoxamine/adverse effects, Pupil/*drug effects, Sympatholytics/*pharmacology, Tyramine/adverse effects",-1

The serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors are effective alternatives for CMI and can be used when the patient cannot use or tolerate CMI. In this review, we examine the pathophysiology of OCD, based on drug response profile, peripheral markers of serotonergic function, pharmacologic challenge studies, and neuroimaging. We also consider the medications found to be effective in OCD, the length of treatment, with special regard for maintenance therapy, and such issues as the approach for the treatment-resistant patient, augmentation strategies, and nonpharmacological treatments.","Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*drug therapy/*physiopathology/psychology, Serotonin/physiology, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use",-1

Based upon review of the literature, an algorithm has been developed, supporting the initial use of cognitive behavioral therapy, followed by a psychopharmacology algorithm if treatment is not successful. In this algorithm, severely anxious patients initially may require psychopharmacologic treatment to be able to participate in cognitive behavioral treatment. Nonspecific measures of parent education, general support, and illness education to parents and patients are overarching principles. In this algorithm, the SSRIs are perceived to be first-line interventions, with tricyclic antidepressants and venlafaxine as second-line agents. Buspirone is considered a second- or third-line agent, as are the benzodiazepines. Table 2 reviews psychopharmacologic agents shown to be useful in the management of anxiety disorders in youth. Although much research remains to be done, there is evidence of efficacy of several interventions for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. There is a need for a holistic and comprehensive management plan. Particular attention must be given to specific psychopharmacologic and psychotherapy needs, family matters, abuse issues, freedom from substance abuse, the use of peer support groups, and the encouragement of healthier lifestyle choices such as exercise. A rising number of well-done, large, placebo-controlled studies are providing increased support for medication and psychotherapy to inform evidence-based treatment.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunosuppressive effects of morphine in patients with pain syndromes. We investigated 10 patients with chronic pain syndromes undergoing treatment with oral sustained-release morphine (30-240 mg/d) before and after 1,4, and 12 wk of treatment compared with healthy control subjects without morphine treatment. Immunological variables of the cellular and humoral immune axis showed that 1) total lymphocyte counts and the distribution of lymphocyte subpopulations, including helper T-cell/suppressor cytotoxic T-cell ratios (CD4/CD8 ratios), did not change compared with baseline or healthy control subjects; 2) proliferation of peripheral mononuclear cells (PMC) was not impaired by morphine treatment; 3) interleukin 2 production increased after 4 wk of treatment with morphine; and 4) immunoglobulin (Ig) production was reduced before initiation of therapy in pain patients and decreased further during morphine treatment, whereas Ig concentrations in the circulation remained at normal levels. These results indicate that treatment with oral, sustained-release morphine does not have a suppressive effect on overall PMC function. On the other hand, Ig production was impaired in patients with chronic pain and was further suppressed by morphine. Whether this suppression of humoral immune function has a clinical impact on the immune system as a whole remains to be determined. IMPLICATIONS: Treatment of patients with chronic pain with oral, sustained-release morphine does not influence cellular immune function, but it suppresses the already attenuated production of immunoglobulins.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Aged, Cells, Cultured, Delayed-Action Preparations, Female, Humans, Immunity/*drug effects, Immunoglobulin M/blood, Interleukin-2/biosynthesis, Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects, Male, Middle Aged, Morphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects",-1
14558685,Substance abuse in adolescents: a complex conundrum for the clinician.,"Greydanus DE, Patel DR",Pediatr Clin North Am. 2003 Oct;50(5):1179-223.,"Substance abuse remains a complex and pervasive conundrum for society and for clinicians seeking to improve the lives of their pediatric patients. Substance abuse is linked to the human instinct for pleasure at any cost and is fueled by enticing encouragement of the media teaching society to seek drug-induced pleasure without fear of negative consequences. Other complications are the limited education about psychoactive substances provided to youth and the health care profession pledged to serve them. Primary care clinicians must provide their adolescent patients with adequate screening and counseling about substance abuse. Treatment of the substance-abusing patient is often a combination of behavioral interventions (including family therapy), and, in limited situations, addiction-specific medications. Research suggests that female drug addicts have a better outcome in female-only drug treatment programs. In addition, new drugs are being developed that target specific brain mechanisms involved in drug addiction; these drugs will have less toxicity and less abuse potential than illicit drugs such as cocaine. Vaccines are being developed that will block the effects of such drugs as cocaine and PCP. Medications developed for the treatment of depression and epilepsy will be a source of medications for the treatment of drug addiction. The study of endorphins and the neurobiology of stress and substance abuse promise to develop potent anti-addiction chemicals, greatly aiding in the war on drug abuse.","Adolescent, Female, Humans, Male, *Physician's Practice Patterns, Substance-Related Disorders/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy, United States/epidemiology",-1

The study group consisted of 190 patients, 110 of them female. The patients were evaluated by 84 providers, 60 of them male. According to the providers surveyed, female patients described more pain than did male patients (P < .01) and were perceived by providers to experience more pain (P = .03). Female patients received more medications (P < .01) and were less likely to receive no medication (P = .01). Female patients also received more potent analgesics (P = .03). Linear and logistic regression analysis showed that patient perception of pain was the strongest predictor of the number and strength of medications given; patient gender was not a predictor. CONCLUSION: Female patients with headache, neck pain, or back pain describe more pain and are perceived by providers to have more pain than male patients in the ED. Female patients also receive more medications and stronger analgesics. In this study, severity of patient pain rather than gender stereotyping appeared to correlate most with pain-management practices.","Adult, Analgesics/*administration & dosage/classification, Back Pain/*drug therapy, Cohort Studies, *Emergency Service, Hospital, Female, Headache/*drug therapy, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, *Neck, Pain/*drug therapy, Prospective Studies, Sex Factors",-1
8922560,Spasticity after stroke. Epidemiology and optimal treatment.,"O'Brien CF, Seeberger LC, Smith DB",Drugs Aging. 1996 Nov;9(5):332-40.,"Spasticity following stroke reflects a spectrum of clinical problems including increased muscle tone, abnormal limb posture, excessive contraction of antagonist muscles and hyperactive cutaneous and tendon reflexes. The prevalence of stroke-related disability in stroke survivors is high, and spasticity may be a significant component of this. Management strategies include a multidisciplinary team approach utilising a variety of rehabilitation techniques. Although some interventions are well tolerated and fairly standardised, older adults may be particularly sensitive to drug treatment-related adverse effects. This article reviews some of the commonly employed interventions, such as oral medications, and some of the newer techniques, such as intrathecal baclofen infusion and botulinum toxin injections. The optimal management of spasticity following stroke in older adults requires careful goal setting and skilful combination of treatment modalities in order to produce the best outcome.","Cerebrovascular Disorders/*complications/epidemiology/*therapy, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/*epidemiology/etiology/*therapy",-1
11272678,Oral gabapentin (neurontin) treatment of refractory genitourinary tract pain.,"Sasaki K, Smith CP, Chuang YC, Lee JY, Kim JC, Chancellor MB",Tech Urol. 2001 Mar;7(1):47-9.,"PURPOSE: Refractory genitourinary pain is a common but difficult condition to treat. Examples of chronic genitourinary pain include orchalgia, interstitial cystitis, pain after bladder suspension surgery, nonbacterial prostatitis, and genital pain related to lumbosacral neuropathy. We report our experience with oral gabapentin treatment for this condition. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant with unclear but therapeutic effects on neurologic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients referred with refractory genitourinary pain were treated with oral gabapentin. There were 9 men and 12 women. In the male patients, the location of pain was testicle (4), bladder (2), penis (1), or prostate (2). In female patients, the pain was located in the urethra (4), bladder (6), vulva (1), or vagina (1). The dose of gabapentin was titrated from 300 up to 2,100 mg/day. Subjective pain severity and 10-cm visual pain scale was used before and 6 months after therapy. RESULTS: The mean dose of gabapentin was 1,200 mg/day (range 300-2,100 mg). Ten of 21 patients reported subjective improvement of their pain. The remaining patients did not perceive any improvement. Gabapentin was well tolerated; only 4 patients dropped out due to side effects. The most common adverse effects were dizziness and drowsiness. Five of 8 patients with interstitial cystitis reported improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although only 10 of 21 patients improved with gabapentin, this cohort included only patients with refractory genitourinary pain that failed a wide range of prior treatments. Gabapentin belongs in the armaterium of the urologist who treats genitourinary pain.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Administration, Oral, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Cystitis, Interstitial/*complications, Female, Humans, Male, Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
12390642,Melatonin as adjunctive therapy in the prophylaxis of cluster headache: a pilot study.,"Pringsheim T, Magnoux E, Dobson CF, Hamel E, Aube M",Headache. 2002 Sep;42(8):787-92.,"BACKGROUND: The periodicity of cluster headache suggests involvement of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, the biological clock. The secretion of melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland and regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is altered in patients with cluster headache. Melatonin shifts circadian rhythms. A previous study of melatonin for primary prophylaxis of cluster headache demonstrated a 50% response rate. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of melatonin as adjunctive therapy in patients with cluster headache who have incomplete relief of their headaches on conventional therapy. METHODS: Nine patients participated in the study, six with chronic cluster headache and three with episodic cluster headache. Patients with chronic cluster headache completed a baseline diary for 1 month, followed by 1 month of melatonin treatment, then 1 month of placebo. Patients with episodic cluster headache received placebo for 1 month, then melatonin for 1 month. Patients continued their usual prophylactic and abortive treatments during the study. Headache frequency, intensity, and use of analgesics were recorded. The primary endpoint of the study was the mean number of headaches per day, with mean daily analgesic consumption and percentage of mild, moderate, and severe headaches as secondary endpoints. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between means on analysis of variance and t testing for the melatonin, placebo, and baseline months for all primary and secondary endpoints. There were no side effects reported. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic cluster headache or patients with episodic cluster headache whose headaches are uncontrolled on conventional therapy do not appear to gain therapeutically from the addition of melatonin to their usual treatment regimens. It is perhaps the phase-shifting properties of melatonin that mediate its effect in patients with episodic cluster headache, and it may be necessary to treat from the beginning of the cluster bout to reset the circadian pacemaker, thus producing a more positive outcome.","Adjuvants, Immunologic/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Aged, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Circadian Rhythm, Cluster Headache/classification/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Delayed-Action Preparations, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Melatonin/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome",-1
10155672,Measuring quality of life in patients with depression or anxiety.,"Whalley D, McKenna SP",Pharmacoeconomics. 1995 Oct;8(4):305-15.,"One-fifth of all disability is caused by psychiatric morbidity, with depression and anxiety the most common conditions. Despite this, and the wide range of pharmaceutical treatments available, few quality-of-life studies have been conducted with depressed or anxious patients. Most studies focus on symptoms and adverse effects, rather than on the impact of these on the patient. Where health status is assessed, inappropriate generic measures have been used. Recently, a depression-specific measure of quality of life, the Quality of Life in Depression Scale, has been developed and is starting to be used in clinical trials. No equivalent measure for anxiety is available. Given the range and rapid increase in the number of treatments available for depression and anxiety, and issues of compliance and individual response to treatment, much more attention must be given to quality of life in these conditions.","Anxiety/drug therapy/economics/*psychology, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/economics/*psychology, Humans, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, *Quality of Life",-1

DATA SOURCES: A compilation prepared by the National Library of Medicine's Interactive Retrieval Services (Medlars II) for the period 1987 to 1994 was used as the data source. STUDY SELECTION: Focus was placed on human comparative clinical studies with well-accepted measures of esophageal healing (endoscopy) and symptom resolution. Safety data were compiled from the clinical trials literature and large postmarketing data studies. Pharmacoeconomic studies selected were judged to meet the criteria of good design, presence of sensitivity testing, and statement of perspective. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were obtained from double-blind, controlled clinical studies. Other data were extracted from pertinent literature of good design and significant results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Overall, the clinical trials of omeprazole for the treatment of patients with erosive GERD demonstrate that omeprazole provides superior therapy in terms of esophageal healing symptom resolution and patient compliance when compared with histamine2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and antacids. In addition, studies also indicate that omeprazole is the most effective agent for the treatment of patients with GERD refractory to other treatments. Dosage adjustment is not necessary in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function or in the elderly. Finally, although the acquisition drug cost for daily treatment of patients with GERD is highest with the use of omeprazole, pharmacoeconomic studies indicate that treatment is more cost-effective with the use of omeprazole than with H2RA or antacid treatment alone or combined with nonpharmacologic approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Based on efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness, omeprazole is the drug of choice for the treatment of patients with endoscopically confirmed erosive GERD.","Clinical Trials as Topic, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Double-Blind Method, Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects/chemistry/economics/*therapeutic use, Gastroesophageal Reflux/*drug therapy, Humans, Omeprazole/adverse effects/chemistry/economics/*therapeutic use",-1
11903539,Low-dose tizanidine with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for detoxification from analgesic rebound headache.,Smith TR,Headache. 2002 Mar;42(3):175-7.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe an outpatient regimen for analgesic detoxification and resolution of analgesic rebound headache. BACKGROUND: Frequent analgesic use is believed to promote the transformation of episodic migraine into a chronic, pervasive headache syndrome. Management of pain precipitated by analgesic withdrawal is crucial to treatment success. Outpatient treatment protocols designed to achieve successful withdrawal will reduce costs and potentially lead to more widespread implementation of therapy. METHODS: Patients with appropriate histories were managed on an outpatient basis for detoxification by discontinuation of the offending analgesic and initiation of treatment with tizanidine and a long-acting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Patients kept diaries of pain and medication use. Results were evaluated at 6 and 12 weeks. Patients able to tolerate no or trivial analgesic use (ie, 4 or fewer doses in each 2-week period) were considered responders. RESULTS: At 6 weeks, 36 patients (65%) were responders. At 12 weeks, 38 patients (69%) were responders. The chronic daily headache pattern had resolved at 12 weeks in 34 patients (62%). CONCLUSIONS: This treatment protocol was well tolerated and yielded a high degree of efficacy, demonstrating that outpatient management can be effective for achieving analgesic withdrawal and resolution of analgesic rebound headache.","Adult, Aged, Analgesics/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Headache Disorders/*drug therapy, Humans, Male, Medical Records, Metabolic Detoxication, Drug, Middle Aged",-1
12016348,Evaluation of electromagnetic fields in the treatment of pain in patients with lumbar radiculopathy or the whiplash syndrome.,"Thuile Ch, Walzl M",NeuroRehabilitation. 2002;17(1):63-7.,"Back pain and the whiplash syndrome are very common diseases involving tremendous costs and extensive medical effort. A quick and effective reduction of symptoms, especially pain, is required. In two prospective randomized studies, patients with either lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 or the whiplash syndrome were investigated. Inclusion criteria were as follows: either clinically verified painful lumbar radiculopathy in the segments L5/S1 and a Lasegue's sign of 30 degrees (or more), or typical signs of the whiplash syndrome such as painful restriction of rotation and flexion/extension. Exclusion criteria were prolapsed intervertebral discs, systemic neurological diseases, epilepsy, and pregnancy. A total of 100 patients with lumbar radiculopathy and 92 with the whiplash syndrome were selected and entered in the study following a 1:1 ratio. Both groups (magnetic field treatment and controls) received standard medication consisting of diclofenac and tizanidine, while the magnetic field was only applied in group 1, twice a day, for a period of two weeks. In patients suffering from radiculopathy, the average time until pain relief and painless walking was 8.2 +/- 0.5 days in the magnetic field group, and 11.7 +/- 0.5 days in controls p < 0.04). In patients with the whiplash syndrome, pain was measured on a ten-point scale. Pain in the head was on average 4.6 before and 2.1 after treatment in those receiving magnetic field treatment, and 4.2/3.5 in controls. Neck pain was on average 6.3/1.9 as opposed to 5.3/4.6, and pain in the shoulder/arm was 2.4/0.8 as opposed to 2.8/2.2 (p < 0.03 for all regions). Hence, magnetic fields appear to have a considerable and statistically significant potential for reducing pain in cases of lumbar radiculopathy and the whiplash syndrome.","Adult, Aged, *Electromagnetic Fields, Female, Humans, Lumbar Vertebrae, Magnetics/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Pain Measurement, Pain, Intractable/etiology/*therapy, Probability, Prospective Studies, Radiculopathy/*complications, Reference Values, Statistics, Nonparametric, Syndrome, Treatment Outcome, Whiplash Injuries/complications/*rehabilitation",-1
9379704,Pregnancy and multiple sclerosis.,"Damek DM, Shuster EA",Mayo Clin Proc. 1997 Oct;72(10):977-89.,"In this review, we summarize the available information on the short- and long-term effects of pregnancy on the course of multiple sclerosis (MS). Published studies that used established criteria for the diagnosis of MS were given more weight than studies in which the criteria for diagnosis were unstated or unclear. Population-based studies were emphasized more than clinic-based studies, unless the clinic base was well defined and thought to be reasonably representative of the MS population in the geographic area. For completeness, small studies were also included but weighted accordingly in our overall conclusions. Methodologic limitations and biases inherent in the study methods are discussed. We conclude that patients with relapsing MS have an increased risk of relapse during the initial 6-month postpartum period. This increased risk does not seem to have a detrimental effect on the rate of developing sustained disability. In fact, a full-term pregnancy may increase the time interval to reaching a common disability endpoint-walking with the aid of a cane or crutch--or to having a secondarily progressive course. Evidence indicates that pregnancy may alter T-lymphocyte functions and cause clinically relevant consequences. The specific biochemical mechanisms responsible for these observations, however, remain undefined. Because of limitations of current knowledge, our conclusions are tentative at best. The data are most applicable to patients with relapsing-remitting MS in its early stages. MS is an unpredictable disease and is only one of many factors that patients must consider when a pregnancy is contemplated.","Acute Disease, Chronic Disease, Cross-Sectional Studies, Disease Susceptibility, Female, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, *Multiple Sclerosis/immunology, Pregnancy, *Pregnancy Complications/immunology, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors",-1
11305407,Energy requirements of spasticity.,"Hemingway C, McGrogan J, Freeman JM",Dev Med Child Neurol. 2001 Apr;43(4):277-8.,"Direct measurement of energy expended by spasticity in children with severe spastic quadriparesis is difficult. Insertion of an intrathecal baclofen pump in a 13-year-old boy with severe spasticity and profound mental retardation resulted in an estimated 30 to 40% decrease in his spasticity. As he had been on a carefully calculated ketogenic diet and fed by gastrostomy, his precise caloric intake was known. Decrease in spasticity, on the same caloric intake, led to marked weight gain. Reduction of 100 calories intake resulted in new weight stability. It was possible therefore, to estimate indirectly energy used by his spasticity. This 100 calories, representing 34% of calories above his resting energy requirement, corresponded to an independently estimated 30 to 40% of caloric expenditure of his spasticity. It was concluded that when calculation of calories is critical, energy utilization by spasticity must be taken into consideration.","Adolescent, Baclofen/therapeutic use, Combined Modality Therapy, Energy Intake, *Energy Metabolism, Humans, Male, Quadriplegia/*diet therapy/drug therapy/metabolism, Weight Gain",-1

The use of fluoroscopy and radiologic contrast material provides confirmation of accurate needle placement within the epidural space. We describe our technique and experience with contrast epidurography and therapeutic epidural steroid injections, and review the frequency of systemic and neurologic complications. METHODS: Epidural steroid injections were performed in 5489 consecutive outpatients over a period of 5 1/2 years by three procedural neuroradiologists. In 155 cases (2.8%), the injections were done without contrast material owing to either confirmed or suspected allergy. The remaining 5334 injections were performed after epidurography through the same needle. Patients and referring clinicians were instructed to contact us first regarding complications or any problem potentially related to the injection. In addition, the referring clinicians' offices were instructed to contact us regarding any conceivable procedure-related complications. RESULTS: Only 10 patients in the entire series required either oral (n = 5) or intravenous (n = 5) sedation. Four complications (0.07%) required either transport to an emergency room (n = 2) or hospitalization (n = 2). None of the complications required surgical intervention, and all were self-limited with regard to symptoms and imaging manifestations. Fluoroscopic needle placement and epidurography provided visual confirmation of accurate needle placement, distribution of the injectate, and depiction of epidural space disease. CONCLUSION: Epidurography in conjunction with epidural steroid injections provides for safe and accurate therapeutic injection and is associated with an exceedingly low frequency of untoward sequelae. It can be performed safely on an outpatient basis and does not require sedation or special monitoring.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Ambulatory Care, Back Pain/drug therapy, Conscious Sedation, Contrast Media, Diazepam/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Emergency Service, Hospital, Epidural Space/*radiography, Female, Fluoroscopy, Follow-Up Studies, Hospitalization, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Injections, Epidural/adverse effects/instrumentation, Male, Middle Aged, Neck Pain/drug therapy, Needles/adverse effects, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy, Radiography, Interventional, Safety, Spinal Diseases/radiography, Spinal Nerve Roots/drug effects, Steroids/*administration & dosage",-1

Treatment with quinine is a common practice, but the effectiveness of the drug is doubtful and adverse drug effects are common. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of vitamin B complex capsules (fursulthiamine 50 mg, hydroxocobalamin 250 micrograms, pyridoxal phosphate 30 mg, and riboflavin 5 mg) in 28 elderly patients with hypertension who had severe nocturnal leg cramps that disturbed their sleep. Self-reported ratings of leg cramp frequency, duration, and intensity were used to evaluate severity of nocturnal leg cramps. Both the patients taking vitamin B capsules (n = 14) and those taking placebo (n = 14) received medications three times daily, and were examined regularly at 2-week intervals for 3 months. After 3 months, 86% of the patients taking vitamin B had prominent remission of leg cramps, whereas those taking placebo had no significant difference from baseline. Treatment with vitamin B complex significantly reduced the frequency, intensity, and duration of nocturnal leg cramps. Because quinine is not without potential for side effects, and vitamin B complex is a relatively safe and effective alternative, clinicians should reconsider the treatment of choice for nocturnal leg cramps.","Aged, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Hypertension/*drug therapy, Male, Quinine/therapeutic use, Sleep-Wake Transition Disorders/*drug therapy, Vitamin B Complex/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",-1

This correlates with MIN6 expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1-4) but only weak expression of NMDA NR2 receptor subunits, as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pharmacological characterization of the MIN6 AMPA receptors showed that AMPA-triggered [Ca2+]i responses were blocked by GYKI 52466, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and pentobarbital. AMPA-triggered [Ca2+]i responses were also blocked in Na(+)-free medium and by the voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel antagonist La3+. Unlike cortical neuronal cultures, which show a loss of membrane-associated protein kinase C (PKC) activity and die in response to excitatory amino acid exposure, glutamate was not toxic to MIN6 cells and it did not decrease PKC activity. These studies indicate that MIN6 cells possess Ca(2+)-impermeable AMPA receptors that secondarily allow Ca2+ influx following AMPA-induced depolarization and that, despite elevating [Ca2+]i, AMPA is not toxic to these cells. The effects of glutamate and glutamate receptor antagonists on pancreatic cells needs to be better understood if these compounds are to be used as therapeutic agents to treat stroke.","6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione/pharmacology, Animals, Anti-Anxiety Agents/pharmacology, Antihypertensive Agents/pharmacology, *Benzodiazepines, Benzothiadiazines/pharmacology, Biological Transport/drug effects, Calcium/metabolism, Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology, DNA Primers, Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists/pharmacology, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology, Glutamic Acid/toxicity, Islets of Langerhans/cytology/*drug effects/*enzymology, Kainic Acid/pharmacology, Protein Kinase C/metabolism, Quinoxalines/pharmacology, RNA, Messenger/analysis, Rats, Receptors, AMPA/*genetics/metabolism, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*genetics/metabolism, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Spider Venoms/pharmacology, Tumor Cells, Cultured, alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic Acid/pharmacology",-1

Early reports were described in patients who consumed analgesics containing phenacetin. In recent data, the removal of phenacetin from analgesic preparations resulted in a reduction in analgesic-induced end stage renal disease in Europe and Australia. However, a reduction in the incidence of analgesic nephropathy has not occurred uniformly, suggesting that phenacetin is not the sole cause. Current data raise concerns regarding adverse renal effects of acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Aspirin taken alone may be of least concern. The diagnosis of analgesic nephropathy is suggested in subjects with chronic renal failure, a history of daily consumption of analgesic preparations, small bumpy kidneys, and renal papillary necrosis or chronic interstitial nephritis. However, the spectrum of disease may be changing, because these agents also may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and chronic renal disease due to nephrosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, and diabetes mellitus. Potential pathogenetic mechanisms in analgesic nephropathy include direct cellular injury induced by analgesics, prostaglandin inhibition with reduction or redistribution of renal blood flow, and interesting new concepts regarding the role of caffeine in increasing oxygen demand and reducing oxygen supply in the medulla. The primary goal of therapy is discontinuation of analgesic consumption. Because of the association between analgesic intake and uroepithelial tumors, surveillance of patients for neoplasm is suggested.","Analgesics/*adverse effects, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects, Chronic Disease, Female, Humans, Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced, Kidney Failure, Chronic/chemically induced, Middle Aged",-1
11806868,Perspectives on the use of anticonvulsants in the treatment of bipolar disorder.,"Brambilla P, Barale F, Soares JC",Int J Neuropsychopharmacol. 2001 Dec;4(4):421-46.,"The authors reviewed the available literature on the efficacy of carbamazepine, valproate, and other newer anticonvulsants for the treatment of bipolar disorder. A comprehensive Medline search was conducted, and all uncontrolled and controlled reports on anticonvulsants used for the treatment of bipolar patients were identified. Carbamazepine and valproate have been shown to be effective in the acute treatment of bipolar disorder, and are the first-choice treatments for lithium-refractory patients. While the efficacy of these drugs in the acute treatment of the illness has been satisfactorily documented, double-blind randomized studies are still necessary to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of both anticonvulsants. Patients on a mixed state and rapid cyclers seem to respond better to valproate and carbamazepine than to lithium. The preliminary data evaluating the efficacy of newer anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate in bipolar patients is still limited, but some of the available findings are promising, and these new agents may represent appropriate third choices for refractory bipolar individuals. Double-blind, controlled studies with the newer anticonvulsants are still largely unavailable, and it will be necessary to evaluate their acute and prophylactic mood-stabilizing effects. The prospects for future therapeutic advances in this area are also discussed.","Anticonvulsants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/psychology, Humans, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1

11978166,Lamotrigine update and its use in mood disorders.,Hurley SC,Ann Pharmacother. 2002 May;36(5):860-73.,"OBJECTIVE: To provide a qualitative, systematic update and review of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy in mood disorders, adverse effects, and costs of lamotrigine. DATA SOURCES: Citations obtained from MEDLINE searches (1985-September 2001) using lamotrigine as a text word, articles identified in reference lists of pertinent articles, abstracts presented at conferences, and research data from GlaxoSmithKline. DATA EXTRACTION: English-language articles were considered for possible inclusion. Each title and abstract was examined to determine whether the publication contained up-to-date information relevant to the objective. Twenty clinical trials that provided data on response rates in mood disorders were tabulated. DATA SYNTHESIS: Lamotrigine's primary action is to modulate voltage-gated sodium channels. Evidence suggests that it decreases glutamate transmission, directly reduces calcium influx, mildly blocks transmitter reuptake, and alters intracellular mechanisms of resting transmitter release. The average half-life of lamotrigine is approximately 24 hours, but decreases to approximately 7.4 hours when used concurrently with phenytoin, and increases to approximately 59 hours with valproic acid. Seven of the 20 clinical trials were randomized, double-blind, and controlled. Existing data are inadequate to evaluate lamotrigine use in major depression. The pooled response rates for patients with depressed, manic, mixed, and rapid cycling bipolar disorder were similar, ranging from 52% to 63%. Adverse effects are infrequent when the drug is used alone, but become more frequent when lamotrigine is combined with other anticonvulsants. While most rashes are mild, approximately 1 in 500 patients develops exfoliative dermatitis. A slow upward dose titration is recommended to reduce the incidence of serious rash, but this may delay the attainment of adequate dosage for 6 weeks. Lamotrigine has positive effects on cognitive function, but occasionally produces insomnia. Lamotrigine costs 2-4 times more than lithium, carbamazepine, and generic valproic acid. CONCLUSIONS: When efficacy, adverse effects, and cost are considered, lamotrigine should probably be reserved as a second-line agent for bipolar depression.","Acetates/therapeutic use, Aggression/drug effects, *Amines, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/drug therapy, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy, Dermatitis, Exfoliative/chemically induced, Dizziness/chemically induced, Drug Interactions, Epilepsy/drug therapy, Exanthema/chemically induced, Headache/chemically induced, Humans, Ion Channel Gating/drug effects, Mood Disorders/*drug therapy, Nausea/chemically induced, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sodium Channels/drug effects, Triazines/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Differential diagnosis includes myofascial pain syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. Fibromyalgia is a multifactorial problem and no universal treatment guidelines apply to all cases. Pharmacologic therapy may incude tricyclic antidepressants. In addition to commonly used pharmacologic therapies, patient education, reassurance and an exercise program can each play an important role in relieving the symptoms associated with this common musculoskeletal syndrome.","Combined Modality Therapy, Diagnosis, Differential, Exercise, *Fibromyalgia/diagnosis/therapy, Humans, Syndrome",-1
9482676,Evaluation of electronic equipment for quantitative registration of tremor.,"Orsnes GB, Sorensen PS",Acta Neurol Scand. 1998 Jan;97(1):36-40.,"OBJECTIVES: To test new electronic equipment, TREMOR, for quantitative registration of rest tremor and kinetic tremor of the extremities. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The tremor intensity of rest tremor and kinetic tremor was studied in 14 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Clonazepam was used in an open study in 11 MS patients to evaluate the sensitivity of TREMOR, compared to the clinical observations. RESULTS: We found no diurnal variations in tremor. Five patients discontinued the trial because of side effects due to clonazepam. Clonazepam significantly reduced clinically rest tremor in all 6 patients and clinically kinetic tremor in 5 patients. Tested by TREMOR all patients showed significant reduction in rest tremor and kinetic tremor. Correlation between electronic assessment of kinetic tremor, clinical score and Peg board test were good. CONCLUSION: TREMOR was found useful for assessment of the severity of tremor in patients with kinetic tremor and thereby avoid intra- and interobserver variation.","Adult, Anticonvulsants/pharmacology, Clonazepam/pharmacology, Electrodiagnosis/*instrumentation/*methods, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Tremor/*diagnosis/drug therapy",-1
10626931,Stereotactic surgery: what is past is prologue.,Kelly PJ,Neurosurgery. 2000 Jan;46(1):16-27.,"Two old and simple simple concepts, a three-dimensional positioning stage and a coordinate system, were combined in 1906 to create a new one: the stereotactic method. For 25 years, it found little application until it was rediscovered for investigations in small animals. After the first human subcortical stereotactic procedure was performed in 1947, stereotactic methods found greatest application in the placement of subcortical lesions in the treatment of movement disorders. Rapid advances in the development of instrumentation, methods, and understanding of human neuroanatomy and neurophysiology resulted. However, a dormant period followed the introduction of L-dopa in 1968. The advent of computer-based medical imaging applied to the stereotactic method encouraged adaptation of stereotactic methods to the management of intracranial tumors, the rapid development of new surgical hardware, and the rediscovery of old methods and evolution of new ones for the treatment of movement disorders. In addition, the incorporation of computer systems as stereotactic surgical instruments further increased the capabilities of stereotactic methods. Radiosurgical applications increased with the proliferation of gamma units and the development of linear accelerator-based radiosurgical methods. Computers are used to fuse and reformat imaging databases for surgical planning, simulation, and frameless stereotactic intraoperative guidance. As a result, surgical procedures have become more effective in meeting preoperative goals and less invasive. Low-cost, high-speed, microprocessor-based workstation computers and intuitive user interfaces have increased the acceptance into mainstream neurosurgery. It is anticipated that a significant portion of neurosurgery, and probably most surgical procedures in general, will comprise computer-based interventions guided by volumetric imaging-defined data sets acquired preoperatively or by intraoperative imaging systems. The stereotactic surgery of the future may employ all or a combination of the following technologies: frameless stereotactic surgery, robotic technology, microrobotic dexterity enhancement, and telepresence robotics.","Brain/anatomy & histology, Brain Diseases/surgery, Computers, Forecasting, Humans, Intraoperative Period, Neurosurgery/methods, Robotics, Stereotaxic Techniques/*trends",-1
9420075,Infusion of intrathecal baclofen for generalized dystonia in cerebral palsy.,"Albright AL, Barry MJ, Painter MJ, Shultz B",J Neurosurg. 1998 Jan;88(1):73-6.,"Generalized dystonia occurs in 15 to 25% of persons with cerebral palsy (CP) and responds poorly to medical and surgical treatments. OBJECT: After the authors observed a woman whose dystonic CP was dramatically improved by continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen, they designed this pilot study to evaluate the effect of this treatment on a group of patients with dystonic CP. METHODS: The authors assessed the short-term response to intrathecal baclofen infusion in 12 patients with dystonic CP. An intrathecal catheter was inserted percutaneously and connected to an external microinfusion pump. The infusion began at a rate of 100 microg/day and was increased by 50 microg every 12 hours until the dystonia abated, adverse effects occurred, or the dose reached 900 microg/day with no improvement. Two observers, one blinded and one not blinded to the patient's treatment status, viewed videotapes made before and after the infusions and graded the dystonia in eight body regions, using a 5-point scale. Overall and regional scores were compared by using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. CONCLUSIONS: Dystonia diminished in 10 of 12 patients whose average daily dose of intrathecal baclofen was 575 microg. Overall dystonia scores and scores for the extremities, trunk, and cervical regions were significantly better after infusion (p = 0.003). The two observers' scores were not significantly different. Programmable infusion pumps were subsequently implanted in eight patients for long-term therapy and improvement was sustained in six (p < 0.05). Intrathecal baclofen infusion is a promising treatment option for generalized dystonia associated with CP. The effects of intrathecal baclofen infusion on dystonia can be evaluated by using short-term continuous infusions.","Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Cerebral Palsy/*complications, Child, Child, Preschool, Dystonia/*drug therapy/etiology, Female, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage, Pilot Projects, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome",-1

The case histories of 75 patients, all receiving morphine spinally, were retrospectively analysed and, of these, 10 suffered from the MSJ syndrome. The following were taken as evaluation criteria: age, sex, performance status, duration and dosage of previous systemic and current spinal morphine therapy, concomitant analgesic and co-analgesic medication, pretreatment of the dorsal column and neurological dysfunction due to damage either of the nerval plexus or of the medulla spinalis. As a result, high spinal morphine doses in conjunction with pathological changes within the spine were shown to be risk factors for this syndrome. Changing from spinal to systemic morphine application or reduction of spinal doses together with the addition of systemic morphine led to complete recovery from MSJ. As underlying mechanism, an imbalance between the activity of spinal and central opioid receptors and/or toxic morphine effects on the medulla spinalis are discussed. In conclusion, great care should be taken when applying morphine to the spine in patients with neurological dysfunction due to an apparent pathology of the medulla spinalis, especially if large amounts of morphine are likely to be required. Some systemic application of morphine might reduce the risk of patients developing MSJ syndrome.","Administration, Oral, Analgesia/*adverse effects, Analgesia, Epidural/*adverse effects, Baclofen/administration & dosage, Clonazepam/administration & dosage, Female, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Morphine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Muscle Spasticity/*chemically induced/drug therapy, Muscle Tonus/*drug effects, Myoclonus/*chemically induced/drug therapy, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Spinal Cord/drug effects, Spinal Cord Diseases/*chemically induced/drug therapy",-1
12879525,Gabapentin and lamotrigine: novel antiepileptic drugs.,"Btaiche IF, Woster PS",Am J Health Syst Pharm. 1995 Jan 1;52(1):61-9.,"The pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of gabapentin and lamotrigine, two new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), are reviewed. Gabapentin and lamotrigine are promising advances in the treatment of epilepsy, which has not been satisfactorily controlled by available agents in 25-41% of patients. Gabapentin is chemically similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid, but it is able to pass into the central nervous system. It is effective for the treatment of partial-onset seizures that are refractory to other AEDs. It has no known drug-drug interactions and a relatively benign adverse effect profile, but its short half-life necessitates at least thrice-daily dosing. Lamotrigine is structurally unrelated to the other available AEDs. Its role is currently limited to add-on therapy in patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalization, that are resistant to current treatment. The efficacy of lamotrigine in patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures, absence seizures, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome remains to be validated. The adverse effect profile also remains to be determined. A rash may appear in up to 5% of patients, possibly necessitating discontinuation of the drug. Although lamotrigine does not seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of the other AEDs, the other AEDs affect lamotrigine pharmacokinetics. Lamotrigine can be given once or twice daily. Gabapentin and lamotrigine may be useful in treating patients whose epilepsy is not controlled by other available AEDs; however, further research is needed to confirm their roles in epilepsy treatment.","*Acetates/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, *Amines, *Anticonvulsants/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/metabolism, Half-Life, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Tissue Distribution, *Triazines/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Like most medical conditions, early diagnosis and treatment increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. Accordingly, patients with clinical signs and symptoms of CRPS after an injury should be referred immediately to a physician with expertise in evaluating and treating this condition. Physical therapy is the cornerstone and first-line treatment for CRPS. Mild cases respond to physical therapy and physical modalities. Mild to moderate cases may require adjuvant analgesics, such as anticonvulsants and/or antidepressants. An opioid should be added to the treatment regimen if these medications do not provide sufficient analgesia to allow the patient to participate in physical therapy. Patients with moderate to severe pain and/or sympathetic dysfunction require regional anesthetic blockade to participate in physical therapy. A small percentage of patients develop refractory, chronic pain and require long-term multidisciplinary treatment, including physical therapy, psychological support, and pain-relieving measures. Pain-relieving measures include medications, sympathetic/somatic blockade, spinal cord stimulation, and spinal analgesia.","Acetates/therapeutic use, Algorithms, *Amines, Anesthesia, Conduction/methods, Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Autonomic Nerve Block/methods, Complex Regional Pain Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Decision Trees, Electromyography, Humans, Patient Care Team, Patient Selection, Physical Therapy Modalities, Referral and Consultation, Thermography, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
8736630,Amitriptyline. A review of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in chronic pain states.,"Bryson HM, Wilde MI",Drugs Aging. 1996 Jun;8(6):459-76.,"Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant agent which also has analgesic properties. Whether its analgesic effects are linked to its mood-altering activity or attributable to a discrete pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown. Clinical trials demonstrate that oral amitriptyline achieves at least a good or moderate response in up to two-thirds of patients with post-herpetic neuralgia and three-quarters of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, neurogenic pain syndromes that are often unresponsive to narcotic analgesics. Amitriptyline has also demonstrated efficacy in heterogeneous groups of patients with chronic non-malignant pain. Other possible areas of use for amitriptyline are in patients with fibromyalgia or as an adjuvant for uncontrolled cancer pain, although evidence for the latter application is limited. Adverse events resulting from the antimuscarinic activity of amitriptyline (primarily dry mouth and sedation) are commonly reported, even at the low dosages used for the control of pain. Low starting doses and careful dosage titration may help to minimise these effects. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, sometimes associated with tricyclic antidepressant agents, may also pose a problem in the elderly. In summary, amitriptyline has a valuable place in the treatment of chronic pain conditions that affect the elderly provided that the drug is used judiciously to minimise adverse effects. Importantly, amitriptyline remains the best studied of the antidepressant agents in post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy and is an important and effective treatment option in these syndromes.","Aged, Amitriptyline/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Animals, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Diabetic Neuropathies/drug therapy, Herpes Zoster/complications, Humans, Neuralgia/drug therapy/etiology, Pain/*drug therapy",-1

METHODS: Patients with RLS (22 idiopathic, 2 secondary to iron deficiency) were randomized and treated for 6 weeks with either gabapentin or placebo. After a 1-week washout they crossed over to the alternative treatment for 6 weeks. Patients were rated at baseline and at scheduled intervals by the RLS Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impression, pain analogue scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. At the end of each treatment period, all-night polysomnography was performed. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, gabapentin was associated with reduced symptoms on all rating scales. In addition, sleep studies showed a significantly reduced periodic leg movements during sleep (PLMS) index and improved sleep architecture (increased total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and slow wave sleep, and decreased stage 1 sleep). Patients whose symptoms included pain benefited most from gabapentin. The mean effective dosage at the end of the 6-week treatment period was 1,855 mg, although therapeutic effects were already observed at the end of week 4 (1,391 mg).

11937086,Is the 5-HT(7) receptor involved in the pathogenesis and prophylactic treatment of migraine?,Terron JA,Eur J Pharmacol. 2002 Mar 29;439(1-3):1-11.,"The mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of migraine and their possible association with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) have not yet been elucidated. One of the major obstacles in achieving this goal is the lack of information on the mechanisms by which the monoamine could possibly trigger and/or modulate the basic pathophysiological features of the condition, that is, cranial vasodilatation and neurogenic inflammation. This information should provide a useful theoretical framework to insight the nature of the postulated fundamental triggering mechanism in the brain that ultimately results in head pain. Novel avenues for research and drug development may be envisaged upon the recent observations showing that 5-HT is actually able to produce vasodilatation of intra- and extra-cranial blood vessels through a mechanism pharmacologically resembling the 5-HT(7) receptor type, and that the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding for this receptor is highly expressed in cranial vessels. Other lines of evidence have suggested that the 5-HT(7) receptor may play an excitatory role in neuronal systems and that it may be involved in hyperalgesic pain and neurogenic inflammation. On the basis of these observations, it is proposed that the 5-HT(7) receptor may well represent a link between the abnormal phenomena of 5-HT processing and neurotransmission that are observed in migraine patients, and the vascular and neurogenic alterations that account for migraine headache. This view is supported by the fact that most of the migraine prophylactic 5-HT receptor antagonists display relatively high affinity for the 5-HT(7) receptor, which significantly correlates with their pharmaceutically active oral doses.","Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Animals, Cyproheptadine/therapeutic use, Humans, Lisuride/therapeutic use, Migraine Disorders/etiology/*prevention & control, Models, Biological, Receptors, Serotonin/*drug effects/metabolism, Serotonin Agents/*therapeutic use",-1

Chemoprophylaxis or intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with an effective antimalarial can ameliorate the adverse effects of malaria during pregnancy. Current guidelines from the WHO recommend that women in highly malarious areas receive IPT with an effective antimalarial. Two central considerations in evaluating drugs for use during pregnancy are safety for the mother and her foetus and effectiveness, which is determined by efficacy, cost, availability, deliverability and acceptability of the drug. These factors may be scored and potential drugs or drug combinations ranked in order of potential effectiveness for use in prevention programmes. The seven most promising regimens are all IPT, primarily because they are more easily delivered and less expensive than chemoprophylaxis. Currently, IPT with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is more likely to have the best overall effectiveness in preventing adverse outcomes associated with malaria in pregnancy. Its low cost, wide availability, easy deliverability and acceptability make it the clear choice in countries where efficacy of the drug remains good. For countries where resistance to SP is rising or already high, amodiaquine (alone or in combination with SP or artesunate) artesunate + SP, chlorproguanil-dapsone (with and without artesunate) and artemether-lumefantrine require urgent evaluation for use in pregnancy.","Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology, Antimalarials/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Drug Combinations, Endemic Diseases, Female, Humans, Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control, Malaria, Falciparum/epidemiology/*prevention & control, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic/*prevention & control, Pyrimethamine/therapeutic use, Sulfadoxine/therapeutic use",-1

Although pharmacotherapy plays an indispensable role in the management of MS symptoms, optimal disease management requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines medication, rehabilitation, and patient education. Successful control of symptoms is critical to quality of life for MS patients. Immunomodulating drugs provide a means of controlling the underlying disease process, but they are not a cure. This places responsibility on health care providers to control a patient's MS-related symptoms to limit disability and delay impairment in the activities of daily living. Owing to the importance of symptom control, comprehensive patient evaluations should be performed at regular intervals to determine the extent of neurological damage and disease progression and to address changing patient needs. The goal of interventions should be not only to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of MS but also to provide access to the psychosocial support that will help MS patients and their families continue to cope as disease status changes.","Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use, Disability Evaluation, Fatigue/etiology, Humans, *Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/physiopathology/rehabilitation, Muscle Spasticity/etiology, Pain/etiology, Patient Education as Topic, Psychotic Disorders/etiology, Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/etiology, Sleep Disorders/etiology, Speech Disorders/etiology, Tremor/etiology, Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic/etiology",-1

Scientists believe that multiple sclerosis may be a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Treatment with high-dose pulses of intravenous methyl-prednisolone is usually associated with a good outcome in the short term. A recent study suggests that interferon beta-1b may decrease the number of relapses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis by 30 percent and also may decrease the development of new central nervous system lesions. Recently, another clinical trial of interferon beta-1a showed a 31 percent reduction in relapse rate and a significant reduction in the average number of active lesions. A third trial showed that 20 mg of copolymer-1, a random polymer of glutamic acid, lysine, alanine and tyrosine, reduced relapses by 21 percent without significant side effects.

All these conditions are more common in the elderly. Neuropathic pain has long been recognised as one of the more difficult types of pain to treat; however, with the current emphasis on providing a multidisciplinary assessment and approach to management, more patients will be offered relief of their symptoms and an improved quality of life. Despite the use of combination drug therapy, adequate pain relief in the elderly is difficult to achieve without adverse effects. In an attempt to minimise these it is important to include non-drug treatment options in the management plan. Lifestyle changes and environmental modification, together with encouragement to adopt an appropriate exercise programme and an emphasis on maintaining mobility and independence should always be considered. Interventional therapy ranging from simple nerve blocks to intrathecal drug delivery can be of value. Drug treatment remains the mainstay of therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, while having significant adverse effects in the elderly, have a number needed to treat (NNT) of 3.5 for 50% pain relief in diabetic neuropathy and 2.1 for 50% pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia. The newer antiepileptic drugs, such as gabapentin, appear to have a better adverse effect profile and provide similar efficacy with the NNT for treating painful diabetic neuropathy being 3.7 and 3.2 for treating pain in postherpetic neuralgia. As our understanding of the complexities of the pain processes increases, we are becoming more able to appropriately combine treatments to achieve not only improved pain relief but also improved function.","Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Capsaicin/therapeutic use, Cognitive Therapy, Diabetic Neuropathies/drug therapy/etiology/therapy, Herpes Simplex/complications, Humans, Lidocaine/therapeutic use, Nerve Block, Nervous System Diseases/*complications, Neuralgia/drug therapy/etiology/therapy, Pain/drug therapy/etiology, *Pain Management, Physical Therapy Modalities, Stroke/complications, Tramadol/therapeutic use",-1

Epidemiological studies have established that epileptic seizures are more frequent in multiple sclerosis than predicted by chance. Partial epilepsies with focal seizures often with atypical symptoms and with or without secondary generalisation are the usual pattern. In the survey special emphasis is laid on the direct correlation between paroxysmal phenomena and plaques now demonstrable by modern imaging techniques. These images have shown that epileptic seizures can be caused by cortical and subcortical lesions and by their accompanying oedema. We extend the review to non-epileptic paroxysmal symptoms, such as tonic spasm, which may be confused with epileptic seizures. As far as they are supported by data, recommendations for diagnosis and therapy are given. Open questions are identified and issues for further research are suggested.","Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Brain Edema/complications, Cerebral Cortex/pathology, Epilepsy/*etiology/physiopathology, Humans, Incidence, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications/physiopathology, Prognosis, Seizures/classification/*etiology/physiopathology",-1
12495367,Treatment of acid-related diseases in the elderly with emphasis on the use of proton pump inhibitors.,Thjodleifsson B,Drugs Aging. 2002;19(12):911-27.,"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionised the treatment of acid-related disorders, and they have also made it possible to define the spectrum of acid inhibition required for optimal treatment in each disorder. Five PPIs are now available: the older drugs, omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole, and the two newest, rabeprazole and esomeprazole. These agents have predominantly been developed in the younger adult population, and data for the elderly population are limited. Subtle differences have emerged between the old and the new PPIs in their pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and efficacy profiles. The degree of clinical relevance of these differences in the adult population is in question. However, according to this review, based on the available data for the elderly and by inference from the adult population, the differences are highly relevant in the elderly population. Studies of the pharmacokinetics of older PPIs demonstrated considerable variation in drug clearance that was reflected in a wide range of efficacy related to acid suppression with standard dosages. The newer PPIs offer several advantages over older agents, particularly in terms of rapid, profound and consistent acid inhibition. Consistent acid inhibition is particularly important in the elderly since clinical response is often difficult to judge in this patient group. An individual's cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 genotype predicts the degree of acid suppression and consequently the clinical efficacy of the PPIs. The older PPIs are predominantly metabolised by CYP2C19, with this being of more importance for omeprazole and lansoprazole than pantoprazole. The hepatic metabolism of rabeprazole is predominantly by nonenzymatic reactions and minimally by CYP-mediated reactions, which therefore confers an advantage over older PPIs in that genetic polymorphisms for CYP2C19 do not significantly influence rabeprazole clearance, clinical efficacy or potential for drug interactions. The metabolism of esomeprazole involves CYP2C19 but to a lesser extent than its predecessor omeprazole. Furthermore, esomeprazole has a more rapid onset of action and less variation in clearance rates than omeprazole. Drug clearance decreases with age independently of CYP2C19 status, exaggerating some of the differences between the PPIs and increasing the risk of drug interactions.","Aged, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects, Dyspepsia/drug therapy/etiology, Enzyme Inhibitors/administration &, dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Gastric Acid/*secretion, Gastroesophageal Reflux/drug therapy/etiology, Gastrointestinal Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology, Helicobacter Infections/drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Peptic Ulcer/drug therapy/etiology, *Proton Pump Inhibitors",-1

It can be caused by both organic and psychologic or psychiatric factors, which can be broken down into local, systemic. psychologic or psychiatric, and idiopathic causes. The most frequently associated conditions are psychiatric (depression, anxiety, or cancerphobia); xerostomia; nutritional deficiency; allergic contact dermatitis; candidiasis; denture-related pain: and parafunctional behavior. Multiple different factors contributing to the oral pain are common, and a systematic approach to the evaluation is important. Identification of correctable causes of BMS should be emphasized and psychiatric causes should not be invoked without thorough evaluation of the patient. A directed history and careful oral examination must be completed to exclude local diseases and identify clues to potential causes. Assessment of medications, psychiatric history and background, and selected laboratory and patch tests may help identify the etiologies of these symptoms. Treatment should be tailored to each patient and may best be managed in a multidisciplinary approach with input from dermatologists, dentists, psychiatrists. otorhinolaryngologists, and primary care providers. A thoughtful and structured evaluation of the patient with BMS has been associated with improvement in about 70% of patients. The remaining patients may benefit from empiric therapy with a chronic pain protocol and continued supportive interactions.","*Burning Mouth Syndrome/etiology/pathology/therapy, Humans",-1

10840082,Sildenafil effects on sexual and cardiovascular responses in women with spinal cord injury.,"Sipski ML, Rosen RC, Alexander CJ, Hamer RM",Urology. 2000 Jun;55(6):812-5.,"OBJECTIVES: Sexual dysfunction is common in women with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and other neurologic conditions. Sildenafil has previously been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to SCI. This study is the first to evaluate the sexual and cardiovascular effects of sildenafil in women with SCIs in a controlled, laboratory setting. METHODS: Nineteen premenopausal women with SCIs were randomly assigned to receive either sildenafil (50 mg) or placebo in a double-blind, crossover design study. Physiologic and subjective measures of sexual response, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded during baseline and sexual stimulation conditions. Adverse events were also recorded. RESULTS: Significant increases in subjective arousal (SA) were observed with both drug (P <0.01) and sexual stimulation conditions (P <0.001), and a borderline significant (P <0.07) effect of drug administration on vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) was noted. Maximal responses occurred when sildenafil was combined with visual and manual sexual stimulation. Cardiovascular data showed modest increases in heart rate (+/-5 bpm) and mild decreases in blood pressure (+/-4 mm Hg) across all stimulation conditions, consistent with the peripheral vasodilatory mechanism of the drug. Sildenafil was well tolerated with no evidence of significant adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that sildenafil may partially reverse the sexual dysfunction commonly associated with SCI in women. Consistent with previous findings in men, the sexual effects of the drug were most evident under conditions of optimal stimulation. Mild, clinically insignificant cardiovascular effects were also noted. Further large-scale studies of sildenafil's effects in women with neurogenic sexual dysfunction are strongly indicated.","Adult, Blood Pressure/*drug effects, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Heart Rate/*drug effects, Humans, Middle Aged, Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Piperazines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Purines, Sexual Behavior/*drug effects/physiology, Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/drug therapy/etiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications/physiopathology, Sulfones",-1
12852705,The use of gabapentin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia.,"Singh D, Kennedy DH",Clin Ther. 2003 Mar;25(3):852-89.,"BACKGROUND: Varicella-zoster virus causes chickenpox and can reemerge later in life to cause herpes zoster or shingles. One of the most common and disabling complications of herpes zoster is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). OBJECTIVES: This article reviews the current primary literature about the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin for the treatment of PHN. Gabapentin pharmacokinetics and drug interactions are also reviewed. METHODS: A literature search in the English language was conducted using OVID Web, which contained the following databases: MEDLINE (1966-present), EMBASE (1980-2002), Current Contents/Clinical Medicine (1999-2002), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1898-present), Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews (fourth quarter, 2002), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-2002). Search terms used were postherpetic neuralgia; zoster; gabapentin; neuropathic pain; pain; pharmacoeconomic; cost; controlled clinical trial; randomized, controlled trial; postherpetic neuralgia and gabapentin; gabapentin and pain; treatment and postherpetic neuralgia; gabapentin and age; gabapentin and gender; gabapentin and ethnicity; and gabapentin and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Gabapentin displays nonlinear absorption kinetics, is minimally protein bound (< 3%), has a high mean (SD) volume of distribution (50.4 [8.0] L), and is excreted via the kidneys as unchanged drug. Two randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trials demonstrated the effectiveness of gabapentin at doses of up to 3600 mg/d to significantly reduce pain (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001), improve sleep (P < 0.01), and improve some parameters on the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (P < 0.05). Dizziness and somnolence were the most common side effects leading to withdrawal from the trials. The recommended dosage in adults is 300 mg at bedtime on day 1,300 mg BID on day 2, and 300 mg TID on day 3, titrating up as needed to 2400 to 3600 mg/d. To reduce adverse events in patients with renal impairment, the dose should be adjusted based on the patient's creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to be effective and well tolerated for the short-term treatment of PHN. However, future controlled studies are needed to determine whether the effectiveness of gabapentin for PHN is maintained for > 2 months, to establish the optimal dose of gabapentin for PHN, and to compare the efficacy of gabapentin with that of other pharmacologic agents used for the treatment of PHN.","Acetates/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, *Amines, Analgesics/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Interactions, Herpes Zoster/complications/*drug therapy, Humans, Neuralgia/*drug therapy/etiology, Pain Measurement, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

They were randomized to receive, in a double-blinded manner, mexiletine 600 mg/d, gabapentin 1200 mg/d, or placebo for 10 days. Anesthesia was standardized, and all patients had access to routine postoperative analgesics on demand. The visual analog scale score assessed pain at rest and after movement. Three months later, all patients were interviewed to identify intensity of chronic pain and analgesic requirements. Mexiletine and gabapentin reduced codeine consumed from the second to tenth day by 50% (P = 0.029; P = 0.018 and P = 0.035 for mexiletine versus control and gabapentin versus control comparisons, respectively). Total paracetamol consumption was also reduced during the same time (P = 0.0085; P = 0.007 and P = 0.011 for the mexiletine and gabapentin groups when compared with the control, respectively). Pain at rest and after movement was reduced by both drugs on the third postoperative day. Pain after movement also was reduced by gabapentin between the second and fifth postoperative day. Three months later, the incidence of chronic pain, its intensity, and need for analgesics were not affected by either treatment. However, burning pain was more frequent in the control group (P = 0.033). IMPLICATIONS: Patients undergoing breast surgery for cancer may develop chronic pain. We evaluated the effect of mexiletine and gabapentin on the acute and chronic pain after breast surgery for cancer. Both drugs reduced the postoperative analgesic requirements, and particularly, gabapentin reduced pain after movement. The overall incidence of chronic pain was unaffected except for burning pain.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Aged, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use, Breast Neoplasms/*surgery/therapy, Chronic Disease, Combined Modality Therapy, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Mastectomy, Radical, Mexiletine/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Pain Measurement/drug effects, Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy, Questionnaires, Time Factors, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Tizanidine hydrochloride, an alpha 2-noradrenergic agonist, has been shown to have an antispasticity effect in single center trials of patients with MS. OBJECTIVE: To compare plasma concentrations of tizanidine with objective measures of muscle tone in patients with MS with moderate to severe spasticity. SETTING: Ten centers, all tertiary referral centers for the specialized treatment of patients with MS, in the United States and Canada. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of tizanidine hydrochloride (8 or 16 mg). PATIENTS: One hundred forty-two patients with spastic MS who were not taking any interfering medication, such as an antispasticity drug or other alpha-noradrenergic agonist, entered the trial. RESULTS: Tizanidine treatment reduced muscle tone significantly, as shown by improved Ashworth scores and increased knee swing amplitude recorded by the pendulum test, both of which correlated significantly with plasma concentration. Placebo had no significant effect on muscle tone. Dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, and fatigue were reported most often in the group treated with tizanidine at peak plasma concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Tizanidine reduces spasticity in MS, and both therapeutic effects and side effects are related to the plasma drug levels.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/adverse effects/*blood/*pharmacology, Canada, Cardiovascular System/drug effects, Clonidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacology, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Multiple Sclerosis/*blood/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Muscle Contraction/*drug effects, Muscle Relaxants, Central/adverse effects/*blood/*pharmacology, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome, United States",1

After a quiescent period which lasted for more than two decades, several promising new compounds have undergone clinical evaluation and a few of these (vigabatrin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, zonisamide) are now commercially available in some countries. Some of the new agents represent structural analogues of pre-existing drugs in an attempt to improve the therapeutic index of the latter (e.g., oxcarbazepine), while others were rationally designed to interfere selectively with inhibitory (vigabatrin) or excitatory (NMDA receptor antagonists) neurotransmission in the brain. Many other compounds were discovered more or less serependitiously and their mode of action is poorly understood. The present article provides a concise review of the clinical pharmacology of the new anticonvulsants which have undergone most extensive clinical testing in patients with epilepsy. Topics discussed include clinical pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, efficacy data in selected epileptic syndromes or seizure types, and adverse effects profile. Although the precise role of these new agents in the overall management of epilepsy remains to be clearly defined, their availability already provides a valuable tool which can be usefully exploited to improve prognosis, especially in patients with the more severe forms of the disease.","Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drugs, Investigational/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Humans",-1

Focal encephalitis and ischemic stroke were the most frequent underlying processes for adult patients. All of the children, but only six of the adults, had long-lasting cerebral disorders whereas the remaining adults had acute or subacute illness. There were 38 patients (84.4%) experiencing a seizure disorder. Twenty-six of them had their first seizure during their acute illness, as the pattern of PLED was encountered. Eight cases had status epilepticus, and seven of them had epilepsia partialis continua. Nineteen patients had a recent seizure in the day when PLEDs were observed but not during EEG recording; 12 patients had their seizures within 10 days before the observation of PLED. PLEDs were grouped into three categories with respect to their extensions: lateralized to one hemisphere (n = 22), localized in one region (n = 17) and being prominent over one side with contralateral spread (n = 6). The last group was found to be more closely associated with frequent seizures or status epilepticus than the other two groups. Our results showed that PLEDs were highly correlated with recent seizures in the majority of the patients. These EEG findings may be considered as a manifestation of an increased neuronal excitability caused by different etiologies; but not an ictal pattern.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Central Nervous System Infections/complications, Cerebrovascular Disorders/complications, Child, Child, Preschool, *Electroencephalography, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Seizures/diagnosis/etiology/*physiopathology",-1

A secondary aim was to assess the adequacy of current pharmacological intervention for spasticity and assess the relationship between spasticity and overall disability. The study design was a simple comparison that examined differences in functional independence in 2 random groups of people with MS subdivided by the presence of clinically significant spasticity. A total of 68 adults with a diagnosis of clinically definite MS were included in the study. Their level of functional independence was assessed using the Newcastle Independence Assessment Form (NIAF), the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), and the Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Spasticity was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale. A subjective analysis was made of the appropriateness of oral antispastic medication by a rehabilitation physician. Thirty-two people (47%) had clinically significant spasticity (Modified Ashworth Score of 2, 3, or 4). Seventy-eight percent of the population were receiving some oral antispastic medication, but 50% were deemed to require some drug adjustment or additional treatment. Individuals with spasticity were found to have significantly higher levels of disability than those who had no spasticity or clinically insignificant spasticity. This study has confirmed that spasticity is highly prevalent in the MS population and is significantly associated with a reduced level of functional independence.

Pyronaridine, an acridine derivative, has been used successfully to treat malaria in China for over 20 years. We compared the efficacy of pyronaridine and chloroquine in African adult patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Yaounde, Cameroon, where chloroquine resistance is well established. METHODS: 96 patients were randomly assigned treatment with chloroquine 25 mg/kg or pyronaridine 32 mg/kg, both orally and divided over 3 days. Patients were followed up for at least 14 days on an outpatient basis. Analysis was by on-active-treatment. FINDINGS: After losses from follow-up (11) or because of self-medication with quinine (four), 41 patients treated with chloroquine and 40 treated with pyronaridine were analysed. Parasite clearance during the 14-day follow-up with chloroquine and pyronaridine was 44% and 100%, respectively. All patients treated with pyronaridine were afebrile by day 3, and parasitaemia cleared by day 4. No serious drug-related side-effects were noted in pyronaridine-treated patients. INTERPRETATION: Pyronaridine was rapidly effective and well-tolerated in African patients with acute, uncomplicated falciparum malaria and may represent an alternative drug against chloroquine-resistant malaria.","Administration, Oral, Adolescent, Adult, Animals, Antimalarials/*therapeutic use, Cameroon, Chloroquine/*therapeutic use, Drug Resistance, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Malaria, Falciparum/*drug therapy/parasitology, Male, Middle Aged, Naphthyridines/*therapeutic use, Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects, Treatment Outcome",-1

Four children were diagnosed with spastic diplegia (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS] level II) and two with spastic hemiplegia (GMFCS level I). A single-subject, multiple-baseline experimental design involving three pairs of children matched for diagnosis was used. A moveable forceplate system was used to test and train reactive balance control. Area per second (i.e. area covered by the center of pressure over a one second period) and time to stabilization from center of pressure measures were calculated following perturbations. The intervention phase consisted of massed practice on the moving platform (100 perturbations/day for 5 days). Analysis included hierarchical linear modeling and a repeated measures ANOVA. All children demonstrated a significant improvement in their ability to recover stability as demonstrated by reduced center of pressure area and time to stabilization following training. These improvements were still present 30 days following completion of training. Results suggest that postural control mechanisms in school-age children (7 to 13 years) with CP are modifiable.","Adolescent, Age Factors, Cerebral Palsy/*physiopathology/*rehabilitation, Child, Child Welfare, Disabled Children, Female, Humans, Linear Models, Male, Movement/physiology, Observer Variation, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), *Physical Therapy Modalities, Postural Balance/*physiology, Posture, Psychomotor Performance/physiology, Recovery of Function/*physiology, Severity of Illness Index, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome, Washington/epidemiology",-1

When compared to the no drug period, all three drug treatments showed an antispasticity effect on the AS, the VII and the amplitude of the first swing and the relaxation index of the pendulum test, p. < 0001. Surprisingly, cyproheptadine and baclofen produced a greater reduction in the VII than clonidine, p. < 01. The amplitude of the first swing in the pendulum test correlated well with the AS, r = .88, and the antispasticity effects of the drugs produced improvements in both measures, a reduced AS and increased amplitude of knee swing in the pendulum test. Therefore, video motion analysis of the pendulum test is as valid a measure of spasticity as the Ashworth scale and is not limited by subjectivity of the examiner.","Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Cyproheptadine/*therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Administration Schedule, H-Reflex/drug effects, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/*rehabilitation, Muscle Tonus/drug effects, Muscle, Skeletal/innervation, Neural Inhibition/drug effects, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Range of Motion, Articular/drug effects, Spinal Cord Injuries/*rehabilitation, Vibration",1

Most trials are of small size, of short duration, and have not reported on functional outcomes. Studies have been published which suggest that badofen, tizanidine, and diazepam are all effective in reducing dinical measures of spasticity, but there is little evidence that they lead to an improvement in patient function. There is no evidence to suggest any difference in effectiveness between them. The evidence that dantrolene has any effect on spasticity is of poor quality. Diazepam and dantrolene are associated with more side effects than baclofen and tizanidine. There is evidence for the effectiveness of gabapentin in reducing spasticity and improving function in the short term, though longer-term studies are needed to establish its true value.

DESIGN: Prospective data collection, descriptive study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Tertiary referral centre pain clinic (Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne) over two years (March 1998 - March 2000). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain profile; functional disability (school absenteeism, sleep disturbance and inability to perform sport); treatments received; outcome. RESULTS: 207 patients (mean age, 13.1 years; 73% females; 29% rural residents) were referred in the two years. Concomitant medical conditions were present in 106/207 (51%) patients, the commonest being cerebral palsy or spasticity (22 patients) and malignancy (18). Complex regional pain syndrome was diagnosed in 44 patients. Functional disability due to pain included school absenteeism (95% of school attenders), sleep disruption (71% of all patients) and inability to perform sport (90% of those able to participate in sport previously). Of the 105 patients who missed five or more days of school because of pain, 93 attended school regularly after treatment. Sleep disturbance improved in 129/146 (88%) patients, and 129/147 (88%) resumed sporting activity after multidisciplinary intervention. Outcome was classified as good in 134 patients (65%), moderate in 32 (15%) and poor in 16 (8%). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic pain in children and adolescents often results in considerable functional disability. Functional improvement can be achieved using a multidisciplinary approach to pain management in children.","Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Chronic Disease, Cost of Illness, Disabled Children, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Pain/*epidemiology/etiology, *Pain Management, Prospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Victoria/epidemiology",-1

Since 1993, four novel agents (felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, primarily for adjunctive treatment of partial seizures. In addition, a water-soluble pro-drug of phenytoin, fosphenytoin, and a sustained-release preparation of carbamazepine have been introduced. The novel anticonvulsants represent a potential improvement for patients whose seizures are incompletely controlled or who experience significant adverse effects with older anticonvulsants. Felbamate, lamotrigine, and topiramate appear to have a broad spectrum of action in seizure control, but felbamate use is limited by the potential for serious adverse effects. Gabapentin, lamotrigine, and topiramate are all well tolerated. Gabapentin has no known drug interactions, whereas lamotrigine and topiramate have limited interactions compared with older agents. The sustained-release preparation of carbamazepine may decrease the incidence of adverse effects and increase patient compliance. Fosphenytoin offers a safer method for intravenous administration of phenytoin and the added flexibility of intramuscular administration. Taken together, these recent advances in treatment may bring about improved efficacy and decreased adverse effects for many patients with epilepsy.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Humans",-1

QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: Treatment guidelines are based on randomized clinical trials. Recommendations concerning other aspects of VZV management (e.g., vaccination) are based mainly on expert opinion. MAIN MESSAGE: Varicella and herpes zoster caused by VZV can give rise to serious morbidity and mortality and should be treated. For preventing chickenpox, safe and effective immunization is widely recommended. Treating varicella-exposed seronegative pregnant women requires special attention because the virus can harm expectant mothers, fetuses, and newborns. The antiviral drugs, acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, have been approved for treating herpes zoster and have a role in reducing the duration of PHN. Established PHN can be managed with analgesics, tricyclic antidepressants, and other agents.

Studies were required to have individual patient data; three key outcome measures (Ashworth Rating Scale for muscle tone, a measure of muscle strength, and Global Tolerability to Treatment Rating); and patients with multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular lesions. Ten trials involving 270 patients met these criteria. Seven studies used baclofen as the positive control; three used diazepam. As measured by Total and Lower Body Ashworth scores, tizanidine and similar spasticity-reducing effects to both baclofen and diazepam. Muscle strength was affected less by tizanidine than by either comparator, and investigators judged tizanidine to have greater tolerability. Within the limits of these comparisons, tizanidine, baclofen, and diazepam were equally effective in decreasing excessive muscle tone in patients with multiple sclerosis or cerebrovascular lesions.

METHODS: A 1-year retrospective chart review of all children who presented to the emergency department with a headache as the chief complaint. RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients (0.7% of all pediatric emergency department visits, mean age = 9.3 years) were included in the study. Primary headaches included 11 migraine (8.5%) and 2 tension headaches (1.5%). Most of the secondary nonneurological headaches were associated with viral and respiratory illnesses (n=37, 28.5%), while the majority of the secondary neurological headaches included 26 posttraumatic (20%), 15 possible ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunctions (11.5%), and 3 cases of aseptic meningitis (2.3%). The neurological etiology in 9 of these children (6.9%) was found to be serious (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, proven ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction, brain abscess, pseudotumor cerebri, and aseptic meningitis). Fifteen patients could not be etiologically classified, either because no specific etiology was found or their discharge diagnoses could not clearly explain the headache. Approximately 10% (5/53) of the CT scans of the head that were performed showed new abnormal findings including hydrocephalus secondary to ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction (2), subdural hematoma (1), epidural hematoma (1), and skull fracture (1). Forty-two patients (32%) were treated pharmacologically. Thirty-nine of the 42 treated patients (93%) were given over-the-counter analgesics, and 9 (21%) were given prescribed analgesics. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the headaches in the pediatric emergency department were secondary to concurrent illness and minor head trauma, and required no pharmacological treatment or only treatment with minor analgesics. In a small minority of patients, headaches were secondary to serious neurological conditions, which required immediate medical attention. Computed tomography scans showed new abnormalities in a minority of patients and should be reserved for those with neurological diagnoses such as head trauma and ventriculoperitoneal shunt, as well as for those patients with recent onset of headaches with no clear etiological explanation, and for those with high-risk medical conditions, such as hypocoagulabilities.

In order to improve the quality of life of these vulnerable individuals, practitioners require education about the correct approach to assessment and management. Assessment should be comprehensive, taking into account the basic underlying pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, peripheral neuropathy, fibromyalgia, cancer) as well as other contributory pathology (e.g. muscle spasm, myofascial pain) and modifying comorbidities (e.g. depression, anxiety, fear, sleep disturbance). Pharmacological management should be guided by a stepped-care approach, modelled after that recommended by the World Health Organization for treatment of cancer pain. Nonopioid and opioid analgesics are the cornerstone of pharmacological pain management. Tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants can be very effective for the treatment of certain types of neuropathic pain. In addition to treating the pain per se, attention should be given to prevention of disease progression and exacerbation, as maintaining function is of prime importance. Nursing home residents with severe dementia challenge the practitioner's pain assessment skills; an empirical approach to treatment may sometimes be warranted. The success of treatment should be measured by improvement in pain intensity as well as physical, psychosocial and cognitive function. Effective pain management may impact any or all of these functional domains and, therefore, substantially improve the nursing home resident's quality of life.","Aged, *Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse, effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Drug Administration Schedule, *Geriatrics, Half-Life, Humans, *Nursing Homes, *Pain/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology, Pain Measurement, Prevalence",-1

Sixty-six patients with severe spasticity of spinal cord origin that was refractory to oral baclofen or who experienced intolerable side effects with this form of the drug were screened. The first nine participated in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo (normal saline)-controlled trial to determine response to a bolus dose of intrathecal baclofen. Subsequent patients were enrolled in an open-label treatment protocol without a placebo trial. All passed the screening, and the pump was implanted in 59 patients. Spasticity scores and medical costs before and after surgery were analyzed. In all patients, the mean Ashworth score for rigidity decreased from 4.3 preoperatively to 1.4 (p < 0.0005) with use of intrathecal baclofen. The spasm frequency score decreased from a mean of 3.6 to 0.5 (p < 0.0005). Activities of daily living, sleep, and skin integrity improved, and pain was eradicated in some. Constipation occurred in six patients. A reduction in dosage was necessitated by muscular hypotonia in three ambulatory patients, areflexic bladder and urinary retention in three others, and nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness in one. Catheter-related problems occurred 19 times in 15 patients. One pump was explanted because of infection in the pump pocket, and one was removed after it eroded through the skin. There were no pump failures. The use of intrathecal baclofen resulted in a decrease in the average length of subsequent hospitalizations. It is concluded that intrathecal baclofen delivered by an implanted programmable pump is a safe, effective, and cost-efficient method for treatment of severe intractable spinal spasticity.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy, Spinal Cord Injuries/*drug therapy, Time Factors",-1

METHODS: Four groups of patients (each has 15) were randomly selected and treated by chloroquine (25mg/kg wt) in comparison with regimen combinations of ketotifen (0.13 mg/kg body wt) with chloroquine, ketotifen with Fansidar (33.3mg/kg body wt) and ketotifen with both chloroquine and Fansidar. RESULTS: Prior to treatment all patients had a parasite density that varied from 1 x 10(3)-3.46 x 10(4)/mL blood. On day 2, the highest level of parasitaemia was recorded in patients treated with chloroquine only. Other patients had a significantly lower parasitaemia (P<0.05) with an average range of 111-243 parasites/300 leucocytes. On day 3 no parasites were detected in groups treated by ketotifen and Fansidar or by ketotifen in combination with Fansidar and chloroquine. The mean time of parasite clearance was minimum (<32 h) amongst patients that had chloroquine administered with ketotifen alone or with both Fansidar and ketotifen. The cumulative percentage of cases with recrudescence was >39% in groups that had the chloroquine regimen alone or the combination of chloroquine with ketotifen. A single case of recrudescence was also diagnosed on day 28 in the group treated with ketotifen plus fansidar but no recrudescence occurred in the group treated with the combination of the three drugs. CONCLUSION: This study indicates the possible role of ketotifen in treatment for falciparum malaria particularly when administered in combination with chloroquine and fansidar.","Adult, Antimalarials/*therapeutic use, Body Weight, Chloroquine/*therapeutic use, Drug Monitoring, Drug Therapy, Combination, Follow-Up Studies, Histamine H1 Antagonists/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Humans, Ketotifen/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Malaria, Falciparum/*drug therapy/parasitology, Malaria, Vivax/drug therapy/parasitology, Recurrence, Single-Blind Method, Sudan, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1
11772130,"Postanaesthetic shivering: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and approaches to prevention and management.",Alfonsi P,Drugs. 2001;61(15):2193-205.,"Along with nausea and vomiting, postanaesthetic shivering is one of the leading causes of discomfort for patients recovering from general anaesthesia. The distinguishing factor during electromyogram recordings between patients with postanaesthetic shivering and shivering in fully awake patients is the existence of clonus similar to that recorded in patients with spinal cord transection. Clonus coexists with the classic waxing and waning signals associated with cutaneous vasoconstriction (thermoregulatory shivering). The primary cause of postanaesthetic shivering is peroperative hypothermia, which sets in because of anaesthetic-induced inhibition of thermoregulation. However, shivering associated with cutaneous vasodilatation (non-thermoregulatory shivering) also occurs, one of the origins of which is postoperative pain. Apart from causing discomfort and aggravation of pain, postanaesthetic shivering increases metabolic demand proportionally to the solicited muscle mass and the cardiac capacity of the patient. No link has been demonstrated between the occurrence of shivering and an increase in cardiac morbidity, but it is preferable to avoid postanaesthetic shivering because it is oxygen draining. Prevention mainly entails preventing peroperative hypothermia by actively rewarming the patient. Postoperative skin surface rewarming is a rapid way of obtaining the threshold shivering temperature while raising the skin temperature and improving the comfort of the patient. However, it is less efficient than certain drugs such as meperidine, clonidine or tramadol, which act by reducing the shivering threshold temperature.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anesthesia, General/*adverse effects, Hot Temperature, Humans, Hypothermia/prevention & control, Incidence, Ketanserin/therapeutic use, Narcotics/*therapeutic use, Nefopam/therapeutic use, Ondansetron/therapeutic use, Serotonin Antagonists/therapeutic use, Shivering/*physiology, Tramadol/therapeutic use",-1

Although it is considered to be an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), mediated by antigen-specific CD4+ T helper (Th1) T-cells, therapeutic strategies aimed at generalised immunosuppression have been disappointing. Recently, immunomodulatory therapies like interferon (IFN)-beta and glatiramer acetate have proved more effective. They reduce the rate and severity of clinical relapses and, in the case of IFN-beta, delay the rate of disease progression. Symptomatic therapies and rehabilitation, however, remain the mainstay of treatment for the majority of patients with MS.

Women of ASA class I-III, requiring gynaecological laparotomy, vaginal hysterectomy, or major vaginal surgery were selected for study. Two hundred and thirty-five received placebo, 231 received 1 mg ondansetron, 228 received 8 mg ondansetron and 229 received 16 mg ondansetron, as an infusion over five minutes before the induction of anaesthesia. A standardized balanced anaesthetic technique was employed. This consisted of premedication with either diazepam or temazepam, thiopentone induction, maintenance with nitrous oxide in oxygen supplemented with enflurane or isoflurane, intraoperative analgesia with fentanyl, neuromuscular blockade with any choice of agent and reversal with neostigmine and atropine. Postoperative analgesia was achieved with morphine, and prochlorperazine or metoclopramide were given if a rescue antiemetic was required.

Incidence, causes and management of these form the major part of this article. Emergencies in palliative care also include sudden severe exacerbation of symptoms. Therefore, onset of severe pain, exacerbation of breathlessness, and worsening of other symptoms are also discussed with their appropriate treatment. A small armamentarium of appropriate medications is thus shown to cover treatment of the various emergencies that may arise. As palliative care deals with patients who are suffering from progressive fatal conditions, death is the expected end. Nevertheless, however well the family are prepared, death often appears for them as an emergency. Comment is made regarding this family emergency in the care of terminally ill people. Attention in this article is focussed on medical treatment. In the care of the emergency event, however, and in all palliative care, management includes making the patient comfortable, thinking of the needs of other patients and relatives observing the event, explaining what is happening and is being done, involving other members of the team, and communicating reassurance to the patient and the relatives as well as to other observers.","Acute Disease, Confusion/etiology/therapy, Dyspnea/etiology/therapy, Emergencies, Family/psychology, Fractures, Bone/etiology/therapy, Hemorrhage/etiology/therapy, Humans, Neoplasms/*complications, Pain/etiology, Pain Management, Palliative Care/*methods, Patient Education as Topic, Recurrence, Seizures/etiology/therapy, Spinal Cord Compression/etiology/therapy, Terminal Care/*methods, Vomiting/etiology/therapy",-1

Gabapentin (800 mg) or placebo was administered t.i.d. in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, trial for 6 months. We enrolled 152 patients at eight sites in the United States. The primary outcome measure was the slope of the arm megascore, the average maximum voluntary isometric strength from eight arm muscles standardized against a reference ALS population. A secondary outcome measure was forced vital capacity. Slopes of arm megascores for patients on gabapentin were compared with slopes of those taking placebo using a two-way ANOVA. We observed a nonstatistically significant trend (p = 0.057-0.08) toward slower decline of arm strength in patients taking gabapentin compared with those taking placebo (mean difference 24%, median 37%). We observed no treatment effect on forced vital capacity. Gabapentin was well tolerated by patients with ALS.

7482387,Excitatory amino acid receptors and neurodegeneration.,Doble A,Therapie. 1995 Jul-Aug;50(4):319-37.,"This review describes recent advances in our understanding of the pharmacology of excitatory amino acid receptors, and the application of this knowledge to the unravelling of the aetiology of neurodegenerative diseases, and to their therapy. Ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors can be divided into two large families, the NMDA receptor family, and the AMPA/kainate receptor family. Receptor cloning studies have shown there to be a large number of potential subtypes of receptors in both these families. Antagonists have been developed for the NMDA receptor which can interact with at least four independent drug recognition sites on the receptor. For the AMPA/kainate receptor, two classes of antagonist have so far been identified. Reasonably potent, selective and brain-penetrating antagonists now exist for virtually all these sites, and compounds inhibiting the release of glutamic acid presynaptically have also been identified, such as riluzole. The ability of glutamic acid to kill neurons (excitotoxicity) seems to be mediated, in most cases, by an interaction with NMDA receptors, leading to an uncontrollable rise in intracellular calcium concentrations and thence cell lysis and death. The setting-up of glutamatergic loops seems to be a key process in the maintenance, spread and amplification of neurodegenerative foci. The existence of such processes has been amply demonstrated in animal models of stroke, in which both NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor antagonists have neuroprotective effects. Clinical trials are underway with NMDA receptor antagonists in stroke. Excitotoxic mechanisms probably also contribute to pathology in head trauma and viral encephalopathy. Ingestion of excitatory amino acids may play a role in neurological conditions of dietary aetiology, such as neurolathyrism and domoic acid intoxication. For chronic neurodegenerative diseases, the role of excitatory amino acids is much less clear, although there is some evidence for the existence of excitotoxic mechanisms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Evidence from animal models suggests that drugs that block glutamatergic neurotransmission might be beneficial in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but the relevance of these animal models to the human pathology is not clear. However, preliminary clinical results suggest riluzole to be efficacious in prolonging survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and certain weak NMDA receptor antagonists are currently used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The next few years could witness a breakthrough in the treatment of neurological conditions as drugs that interfere with glutamatergic transmission become available for clinical use.","AIDS Dementia Complex/metabolism, Animals, Central Nervous System/injuries/metabolism, Cerebrovascular Disorders/metabolism, Glutamic Acid/metabolism, Humans, *Nerve Degeneration, Receptors, Glutamate/classification/*metabolism",-1

Increased bone fragility was postulated to be due to osteopenia resulting from a combination of factors including immobilization and antiepileptic treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium substitution on bone mineral density (BMD) in a group of children with CP in full-time care. Twenty children with the most severe form of CP (spastic quadriplegia) who had been treated with antiepileptic drugs for a relatively long period of time were included in the study. Physical examination and laboratory analyses excluded other possible causes of osteopenia. BMD was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry. Thirteen patients were treated for 9 months with 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol vitamin D (0.25 mcg daily) and with calcium (500 mg daily). Seven control children were used for observation only. BMD greatly increased in the treated group, while children with CP in full-time care who did not receive vitamin D and calcium substitution continued to lose their bone mass. It can be concluded that the addition of vitamin D and calcium increases BMD in children with the most severe form of CP, who are receiving antiepileptic drugs.","Absorptiometry, Photon, Adolescent, Adolescent, Institutionalized, Alkaline Phosphatase/blood, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Bone Density/*drug effects, Bone Diseases, Metabolic/blood/complications/*drug therapy, Calcitriol/*administration & dosage, Calcium/*administration & dosage/blood, Cerebral Palsy/blood/*complications, Child, Child, Institutionalized, Epilepsy/blood/*complications/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Phosphates/blood, Treatment Outcome",-1

Drugs that antagonize excitatory amino acid function are consistently neuroprotective in preclinical models of stroke, and many are now entering clinical trials. SUMMARY: Antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are furthest advanced in clinical development for stroke. Both noncompetitive (aptiganel hydrochloride, dextrorphan) and competitive (selfotel, d-CPPene) antagonists have undergone tolerability studies in acute stroke and traumatic brain injury. These agents all cause a similar spectrum of neuropsychological symptoms, and several have important cardiovascular effects. Other modulatory sites on the NMDA receptor complex, notably the polyamine and magnesium ion sites, are also the subject of clinical trials. Glycine site antagonists are in early clinical development. Non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists remain in preclinical study. Neuroprotection by agents that block glutamate release in vitro may be due to sodium channel blockade in vivo, but some agents (619C89) exhibit neurological effects similar to NMDA antagonists in stroke. The therapeutic index is unknown for different drugs but may be determined by cardiovascular effects, especially hypotension, which may be detrimental after stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Excitatory amino acid antagonists are in advanced development in the treatment of stroke and traumatic brain injury. A similar pattern of side effects is apparent with the majority of agents. However, cardiovascular effects may ultimately define therapeutic index for each drug.","Brain Ischemia/*drug therapy, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Glutamic Acid/metabolism, Glycine/antagonists & inhibitors, Humans, Magnesium/antagonists & inhibitors, Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Polyamines/antagonists & inhibitors, Receptors, Glutamate/drug effects, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors, Sodium Channel Blockers",-1

This article will review the general principles of pharmacological treatment for headache and the physical approach to treatment of headaches and head and facial pain. The major categories of medications commonly used for treatment of many varieties of headache will be discussed. In addition, the problems encountered in diagnosing and treating chronic daily headache and analgesic rebound headache are addressed. The approach to treatment of such syndromes as myofascial pain, cervico-zygapophyseal joint pain, neuritic pain, and craniocervical somatic pain are outlined.","Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Craniocerebral Trauma/*complications, Ergotamine/therapeutic use, Headache/*drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Myofascial Pain Syndromes/drug therapy, Sumatriptan/therapeutic use, Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome/therapy, Treatment Outcome, Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use",-1
11723387,Botulinum treatment of spasticity: why is it so difficult to show a functional benefit?,Sheean GL,Curr Opin Neurol. 2001 Dec;14(6):771-6.,"Clinical experience seems to indicate that botulinum toxin injections can, in selected patients with upper motor neurone syndrome, reduce spasticity and improve voluntary movement and active function. However, double-blind placebo-controlled trials have had difficulty showing active functional improvement, despite the clear ability of botulinum toxin to reduce spasticity. This prompts a re-analysis of the basic assumption that spasticity impairs voluntary movement and a review of the methodology of the clinical trials. Motor dysfunction is usually caused by weakness and the other ""negative"" features of upper motor neurone syndrome, rather than muscle overactivity. Recent research has explored the pathophysiological basis of the voluntary movement disorder, in particular the role of the various forms of motor overactivity, which might be amenable to botulinum toxin treatment. The failure of double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials to show improvement in active function is, to a large extent, a result of their methodology, especially patient selection, injection protocols, and the choice of outcome measures. Clinical trials need to be re-designed and based upon expert experience and a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the motor disorder.","Botulinum Toxins, Type A/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Injections, Intramuscular, Motor Neuron Disease/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Muscle Spasticity/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Neurologic Examination/*drug effects, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Research Design, Treatment Outcome",-1

Twelve female patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and 12 age-matched female healthy individuals (HI) participated in the study. The current pain intensity (CPI) and the pressure pain threshold (PPT) of the superficial masseter muscles were assessed bilaterally. 5-HT in one of three randomized concentrations (10(-3), 10(-5), 10(-7) M) or isotonic saline was then injected into either of the two masseter muscles in a double-blind manner. After the injections the CPI and PPT were recorded ten times during 30 min. The injections were repeated twice with the other concentrations of 5-HT after 1 and 2 weeks, respectively. In the FM-group there was a non-significant increase of CPI after injection that lasted during the entire 30-min period irrespective of whether 5-HT or saline was injected. Neither did the PPT change significantly. In the HI-group pain developed significantly after injection irrespective of whether 5-HT or saline was injected, but significantly more so after 5-HT at 10(-3) M than saline injection. CPI decreased quickly and then remained on a very low level for most of the experiment. 5-HT at both 10(-5) M and 10(-3) M caused a significantly greater decrease of PPT than saline. In conclusion, our results show that 5-HT injected into the masseter muscle of healthy female subjects elicits pain and allodynia/hyperalgesia, while no such responses occur in patients with fibromyalgia.","Adult, Double-Blind Method, Female, Fibromyalgia/*physiopathology, Humans, Hyperalgesia/*chemically induced/physiopathology, Injections, Intramuscular, Masseter Muscle/physiopathology, Middle Aged, Pain/*chemically induced/physiopathology, Pain Measurement, Pain Threshold/drug effects, Pressure, *Serotonin/administration & dosage/blood",-1

11281816,Novel treatments for bipolar disorder.,Bowden CL,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2001 Apr;10(4):661-71.,"Treatments other than lithium have recently emerged as equally important in the management of bipolar disorder. The spectrum of efficacy of newer treatments differs from lithium and among the novel drug treatments valproate, generally used as the better tolerated divalproex form, principally benefits manic symptomatology both acutely and in prophylaxis. Atypical antipsychotic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in reducing acute manic symptoms. No controlled evidence of efficacy in prophylaxis has been published. Lamotrigine has demonstrated efficacy in both acute bipolar depression and maintenance efficacy in rapid cycling bipolar patients, especially those patients with bipolar II disorder, which is principally manifested as depression. Randomised, double-blind, placebo- controlled studies provide good evidence that regimens of risperidone or olanzapine in combination with lithium or valproate provide greater improvement in acute mania than the mood stabilisers alone. Similarly, valproate combined with antipsychotics provided greater improvement in mania than antipsychotic medication alone and resulted in lower dosage of the antipsychotic medication. A positive but unclear placebo-controlled study of omega-3 fatty acids added to lithium in bipolar disorder needs confirmation in standard clinical trial paradigms. Several other drugs that were reported as beneficial in various facets of bipolar disorder in open trials have not differed from placebo when studied in randomised, placebo-controlled trials.","Acetates/therapeutic use, *Amines, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Carbamazepine/therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Therapy, Combination, Fatty Acids, Omega-3/therapeutic use, Fructose/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Humans, Triazines/therapeutic use, Valproic Acid/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

It is argued that regulators and the medical profession rely too heavily on manufacturers to investigate warnings from doctors' spontaneous reporting of adverse effects of drug products on the market. It is demonstrated that a pharmaceutical firm's commitment to search effectively for evidence against the safety of its own product in order to confirm doctors' warnings can have severe limitations. Deficiencies in the socio-institutional responses to post-market 'early warning systems' about drug hazards imply that the regulatory policies of 'early licensing' and minimal pre-market checks for new drugs are misconceived and threaten public health. To improve public protection from drug injury, the regulators should abandon their conviction that compelling evidence of drug hazards are required to confirm doctors' warning signals prior to regulatory intervention. Instead, they should adopt a policy of measured regulatory intervention as an immediate response to warning signals, while investigators, independent of the manufacturers, assess the significance of the signal.","*Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems/legislation & jurisprudence, Anti-Anxiety Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, *Disclosure/legislation & jurisprudence, Drug Approval/legislation & jurisprudence, Drug Industry/*standards, Government Agencies/*standards, Great Britain, Humans, International Cooperation, Netherlands, Physician's Role, Power (Psychology), *Product Surveillance, Postmarketing, Public Health, Triazolam/administration & dosage/*adverse effects",-1

In this report, continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen was used to treat the severe spasticity of an 8-year-old patient with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. The improvement in this patient's quality of life, including the elimination of pain and the increased ease of care, suggests that intrathecal baclofen should be considered as part of the treatment strategy for spasticity associated with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and other neurodegenerative disorders in children and adults.","Adrenoleukodystrophy/*drug therapy, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Child, *Home Infusion Therapy, Humans, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage, Treatment Outcome",-1

Glutamate itself serves vitally important functions in the CNS but has enormous neurodestructive potential. NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists protect many neurons against glutamate neurotoxicity, while injuring or destroying certain other neurons and inducing psychotic symptoms and memory impairment. Therefore, the challenge in developing protective therapies against glutamate's neurodestructive potential is to find benevolent agents that are not malevolent as well. There are two possible approaches. One is to develop neuroprotective agents that are free from neuropsychopathological side effects; the other is to use NMDA antagonists even though they have neuropsychopathological side effects, but to use them in combination with other agents that block the side effects without producing side effects of their own.","Animals, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/*toxicity, Humans, Nerve Degeneration/drug effects, Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*antagonists & inhibitors",-1
11693467,Lansoprazole: an update of its place in the management of acid-related disorders.,"Matheson AJ, Jarvis B",Drugs. 2001;61(12):1801-33.,"Lansoprazole is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion and also exhibits antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori in vitro. Current therapy for peptic ulcer disease focuses on the eradication of H. pylori infection with maintenance therapy indicated in those patients who are not cured of H. pylori and those with ulcers resistant to healing. Lansoprazole 30 mg combined with amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 250 or 500mg, or metronidazole 400 mg twice daily was associated with eradication rates ranging from 71 to 94%, and ulcer healing rates were generally >80% in well designed studies. In addition, it was as effective as omeprazole- or rabeprazole-based regimens which included these antimicrobial agents. Maintenance therapy with lansoprazole 30 mg/day was significantly more effective than either placebo or ranitidine in preventing ulcer relapse. Importantly, preliminary data suggest that lansoprazole-based eradication therapy is effective in children and the elderly. In the short-term treatment of patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), lansoprazole 15, 30 or 60 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo, ranitidine 300 mg/day or cisapride 40 mg/day and similar in efficacy to pantoprazole 40 mg/day in terms of healing of oesophagitis. Lansoprazole 30 mg/day, omeprazole 20 mg/day and pantoprazole 40 mg/day all provided similar symptom relief in these patients. In patients with healed oesophagitis. 12-month maintenance therapy with lansoprazole 15 or 30 mg/day prevented recurrence and was similar to or more effective than omeprazole 10 or 20 mg/day. Available data in patients with NSAID-related disorders or acid-related dyspepsia suggest that lansoprazole is effective in these patients in terms of the prevention of NSAID-related gastrointestinal complications, ulcer healing and symptom relief. Meta-analytic data and postmarketing surveillance in >30,000 patients indicate that lansoprazole is well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination with antimicrobial agents. After lansoprazole monotherapy commonly reported adverse events included dose-dependent diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, headache and abdominal pain. After short-term treatment in patients with peptic ulcer, GORD, dyspepsia and gastritis the incidence of adverse events associated with lansoprazole was generally < or = 5%. Similar adverse events were seen in long-term trials, although the incidence was generally higher (< or = 10%). When lansoprazole was administered in combination with amoxicillin, clarithromycin or metronidazole adverse events included diarrhoea, headache and taste disturbance. In conclusion, lansoprazole-based triple therapy is an effective treatment option for the eradication of H. pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer disease. Preliminary data suggest it may have an important role in the management of this infection in children and the elderly. In the short-term management of GORD, lansoprazole monotherapy offers a more effective alternative to histamine H2-receptor antagonists and initial data indicate that it is an effective short-term treatment option in children and adolescents. In adults lansoprazole maintenance therapy is also an established treatment option for the long-term management of this chronic disease. Lansoprazole has a role in the treatment and prevention of NSAID-related ulcers and the treatment of acid-related dyspepsia; however, further studies are needed to confirm its place in these indications. Lansoprazole has emerged as a useful and well tolerated treatment option in the management of acid-related disorders.","2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles, Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects, Anti-Ulcer Agents/administration & dosage/adverse, effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Dyspepsia/drug therapy, Gastrointestinal Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Lansoprazole, Omeprazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs &, derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Peptic Ulcer/chemically induced/drug therapy",-1

METHODS: This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized dose titration study. After baseline assessment and randomization, the dose could be increased if seizures persisted and reduced if side effects occurred. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline and at the end of the study. By a protocol amendment post hoc, all randomized patients were offered a standardized perimetry examination at the end of the study. Improvement rate was the proportion of patients with a reduction of seizure frequency of at least 50% during an 8-week period without any adverse events causing withdrawal. RESULTS: One hundred two patients were randomized and analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. The improvement rate was 48% in the gabapentin group and 56% in the vigabatrin group. The improvement rate, when per protocol criteria were fulfilled, was 57% in the gabapentin group and 59% in the vigabatrin group. The proportion of seizure-free patients was 31% in the gabapentin group and 39% in the vigabatrin group. There was no difference in quality-of-life scores between the groups. Perimetry after termination of the study on 64 patients showed abnormal results in 3 of 32 patients in the vigabatrin group. CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of the patients in both groups became seizure-free. Although no major differences were seen in terms of the improvement rate between the groups, equivalence between the two drugs was not found.","Acetates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Child, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsies, Partial/*drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Research Design, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Vigabatrin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

By contrast, there is limited clinical experience regarding the use of IT baclofen in treating patients with dystonia, and little is known regarding the indications for treatment, efficacy, and safety of IT baclofen in this disorder. OBJECTIVE: To study retrospectively the effects of IT baclofen in treating 25 patients with severe segmental or generalized dystonia. SETTING: Neurological Institute, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York, NY. PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients with severe segmental or generalized dystonia that was refractory to oral medications underwent IT baclofen test dosing. In addition to dystonia, 17 patients had spasticity or painful spasms. Thirteen of 25 patients responded to the test doses of IT baclofen, according to unblinded neurological assessments that included the patient's subjective report; all 13 underwent implantation of a pump for continuous IT baclofen infusion. RESULTS: In contrast to reports of patients with spasticity of spinal origin, those with dystonia in the present series had a lower response rate to bolus IT baclofen doses and a smaller degree of clinical improvement. For 10 of the 13 responders to the test doses of IT baclofen, dystonia rating scale scores of videotaped examinations by blinded observers detected no significant change (P < .07) in severity of dystonia. Retrospective data from 11 of 13 patients with implantable pumps, followed up for a mean interval of 21 months after pump insertion, showed continuing efficacy in 6 individuals (55%), based on a determination of patient satisfaction; however, only 3 patients (27%) reported a sustained improvement in functional capacity. Five (38%) of the 13 patients with implantable pumps experienced severe complications that required hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent reports that have described the benefit in small numbers of patients with dystonia, we concluded that the role of IT baclofen in treating severe dystonia remains uncertain. Intrathecal baclofen may be more effective when dystonia is associated with spasticity or pain. In the present series, we detected no significant difference in the response to IT baclofen in patients with or without spasticity or pain, perhaps owing to the small sample size.","Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Dystonia/*drug therapy, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Retrospective Studies, Spinal Cord",-1
10551442,Zanamivir: a review of its use in influenza.,"Dunn CJ, Goa KL",Drugs. 1999 Oct;58(4):761-84.,"Zanamivir is a novel inhibitor of the enzyme neuraminidase, a surface glycoprotein essential for the replication of type A and B influenza viruses. Statistically significant reductions in median time to alleviation of major symptoms of influenza were reported in phase II and III studies of zanamivir. Benefit was seen with early treatment (within 30 or 36 hours of onset of illness) in phase II trials. Median times to alleviation of major (or 'clinically significant') symptoms were reduced by 1 to 2.5 days after treatment with zanamivir 10 mg twice daily by oral inhalation for 5 days in 3 phase III studies. Benefit of zanamivir treatment in terms of time to return to normal activities and reductions in consumption of paracetamol (acetaminophen), and reductions in the level of interference of influenza with sleep, work, leisure and recreational activities, were reported. Reductions relative to placebo of 2.5 to 3.25 days were observed in median time to alleviation of major symptoms in high-risk patients. Available data also indicate potential of zanamivir in the prophylaxis of influenza. A statistically significant reduction in the incidence of influenza A was reported with zanamivir 10 mg by oral inhalation once daily for 4 weeks in a double-blind study in 1107 persons in 2 university communities. Prophylactic benefit of zanamivir in influenza A and B outbreaks has also been suggested by data from a nursing home community. Adverse event profiles in patients receiving zanamivir therapeutically or prophylactically appear similar to those in patients receiving placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in therapeutic trials have been nasal signs and symptoms, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, bronchitis and cough. CONCLUSIONS: Prompt treatment with zanamivir in patients with naturally acquired influenza is associated with significant reductions in duration of symptomatic illness, accelerated return to normal levels of activity and reduced consumption of antibiotics for influenza-related complications. While vaccination in selected populations remains the seasonal intervention of choice for prophylaxis, the efficacy, good tolerability and lack of resistance seen with zanamivir are likely to make the drug a valuable treatment option, particularly in individuals not covered or inadequately protected by vaccination, and in those at high risk of influenza-related complications. Confirmation of the prophylactic efficacy of zanamivir would indicate a major potential role for the drug in this setting, especially in persons for whom vaccination is not suitable or fully effective, in closed communities (e.g. nursing homes) and in individuals at high risk.","Antiviral Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Resistance, Microbial/physiology, Guanidines, Humans, Influenza, Human/*drug therapy/prevention & control/virology, Pyrans, Sialic Acids/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Zanamivir",-1

Epileptic spasms usually appear in clusters and are age-dependent. This type of epileptic spasms associated with the particular EEG pattern, hypsar rhythmia, constitutes the basis for the diagnosis of West syndrome. The question is, how to nosologically define those patients who clearly present epileptic spasms in clusters without modified or typical hypsarrhythmia and with or without focal paroxysmal discharges on the interictal EEG. In the present series, the four patients show that epileptic spasms in clusters may occur in infancy, without hypsarrhythmia. They all presented the following features: normal neuropsychological development before onset of epileptic spasms, clusters of epileptic spasms, focal clinical and/or EEG abnormalities, normal neuroradiological imaging, neurometabolic investigations and karyotypes. In three of the patients, seizures were refractory to AEDs. Epileptic spasms in clusters without hypsarrhythmia that start in the first year of life represent a subtype of infantile spasms that generally are refractory to AEDs.

7527761,"Lansoprazole. A reappraisal of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and its therapeutic efficacy in acid-related disorders.","Spencer CM, Faulds D",Drugs. 1994 Sep;48(3):404-30.,"Lansoprazole is a benzimidazole derivative that effectively decreases gastric acid secretion, regardless of the primary stimulus, via inhibition of gastric H+,K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase). It provides effective symptom relief and healing of peptic ulcer and reflux oesophagitis after 4 to 8 weeks of therapy and appears to prevent recurrence of lesions when administered as maintenance therapy. When administered at therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produced higher healing rates than ranitidine or famotidine in patients with duodenal and gastric ulcers. Lansoprazole heals duodenal ulcers more rapidly than ranitidine or famotidine. Relief of ulcer symptoms in lansoprazole recipients is at least equivalent to, and tends to be more rapid than, that in patients receiving histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In comparisons with omeprazole 20 mg/day, lansoprazole 30 mg/day produced duodenal ulcer healing more rapidly and reduced ulcer pain to a greater extent at 2 weeks, but overall healing rates were similar after 4 weeks of therapy. At therapeutic dosages, lansoprazole produces superior healing and symptom relief of reflux oesophagitis in comparison with ranitidine, and it tends to relieve heartburn more effectively than omeprazole, although both agents produce equivalent healing. Healing of peptic ulcers or reflux oesophagitis refractory to histamine H2-receptor antagonists occurs after 8 weeks in the majority of patients treated with lansoprazole, and lansoprazole and omeprazole demonstrate similar efficacy in patients with refractory peptic ulcers. In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, lansoprazole effectively controls mean basal gastric acid output. Lansoprazole is generally well tolerated in clinical trials. The incidence of adverse effects is similar to that of omeprazole, ranitidine and famotidine in comparative studies. Combination therapy with lansoprazole and antibacterial agents such as amoxicillin, tinidazole, roxithromycin and/or metronidazole appears to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in 22 to 80% of patients with this organism. Limited data also suggest that lansoprazole may have superior activity against H. pylori in comparison with omeprazole, although the clinical relevance of this preliminary finding requires further confirmation. Thus, lansoprazole may be considered as alternative to existing antisecretory agents available for the treatment of acid-related disorders, particularly because it may provide more rapid healing and relief of symptoms.","2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles, Animals, Anti-Ulcer Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Humans, Lansoprazole, Omeprazole/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic, use, Stomach Ulcer/*drug therapy",-1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen spastic MS patients were examined in a placebo controlled double-blind, cross-over trial of oral baclofen treatment. The gait was measured on a computerized treadmill and postural stability was measured on a computer assisted force-plate. RESULTS: Only insignificant improvements in the clinical measurements during baclofen treatment were found. At baseline gait was characterized by low speed, short steps and unsteadiness. Postural stability was severely impaired. During baclofen treatment only vertical unsteadiness of gait diminished significantly. DISCUSSION: We conclude that patients primarily with spasticity, concomitant with hampering or painful spasms and co-contractions should be offered treatment with baclofen. Only some will experience improvement of their gait disorders, when treated with baclofen.","Adult, Analysis of Variance, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Cross-Over Studies, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Gait/*drug effects, Gait Disorders, Neurologic/*drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/complications/*drug therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology, Posture, Treatment Outcome",1

7919566,Tacrine: first drug approved for Alzheimer's disease.,Crismon ML,Ann Pharmacother. 1994 Jun;28(6):744-51.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, biopharmaceutics/pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and therapeutic considerations regarding the use of tacrine in patients with Alzheimer's disease. DATA SOURCES: Data from the scientific and professional literature were analyzed, interpreted, and summarized. Citations were obtained by performing a MEDLINE search using the following indexing terms: tacrine, tetrahydroaminoacridine, and Alzheimer's drug therapy. Data also were obtained from a summary of the New Drug Application (Summary Basis of Approval of Cognex) and from the approved product labeling. STUDY SELECTION: Studies in Alzheimer's disease have been plagued by methodologic inconsistencies and deficiencies. Only efficacy studies subsequent to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) issuance of recommendations for studies in Alzheimer's disease (1991) were used. Therefore, only double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design studies of at least three-month's duration using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Clinical Interview-Based Impression of Change as efficacy parameters were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Trials were assessed according to the criteria listed above. Results were evaluated on the basis of both completed patients and last observation carried forward models. DATA SYNTHESIS: Tacrine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that increases the availability of acetylcholine in muscarinic neurons. It has a mean bioavailability after oral administration of about 17 percent and an elimination half-life of approximately three hours. Although drug interactions are poorly studied, tacrine is metabolized by isoenzyme P-450IA2 and may interact with other drugs metabolized by this isoenzyme. Tacrine has been shown to have efficacy in mildly to moderately impaired Alzheimer's patients on both psychometric testing and a clinician's structured interview. Although efficacious, its effects are not dramatic, and it does not affect the ultimate course of the disease. Adverse effects are frequent, and significantly elevated hepatic transaminase concentrations may occur in approximately 25 percent of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Tacrine is the first drug approved by the FDA for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Although it may improve psychometric test scores in mild to moderately impaired patients, it is not a panacea and does not affect the course of the disease. Patients must be monitored closely for elevated transaminase, cholinergic adverse effects, and interactions with drugs metabolized through P-450IA2.","Alanine Transaminase/blood, Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy, Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood, Drug-Induced Liver Injury, Female, Humans, Liver Diseases/enzymology, Male, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Tacrine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Transaminases/metabolism",-1

Additionally, most patients with RLS have periodic limb movements during sleep and relaxed wakefulness. The aetiology of RLS remains unknown. Treatment of RLS is generally symptomatic, a causal therapy is possible only in the secondary forms. Dopaminergic agents including levodopa and dopamine agonists such as pergolide, pramipexole, cabergoline and ropinirole are regarded as the treatment of choice for idiopathic RLS, however, the development of augmentation of symptoms, especially under levodopa therapy, may be a major problem. Except in special circumstances, opioids and anticonvulsants such as gabapentin or benzodiazepines, are regarded as second-line treatment. In secondary RLS, the underlying illness should first be treated, although dopaminergic drugs may also be helpful.","Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Diagnosis, Differential, Dopamine Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Humans, Narcotics/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Restless Legs Syndrome/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

Therefore, there is expanding interest in new therapeutical strategies. Anecdotal reports suggested that the use of cannabis might improve not only tics, but also behavioural problems in patients with TS. A single-dose, cross-over study in 12 patients, as well as a 6-week, randomised trial in 24 patients, demonstrated that Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the most psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, reduces tics in TS patients. No serious adverse effects occurred and no impairment on neuropsychological performance was observed. If well-established drugs either fail to improve tics or cause significant adverse effects, in adult patients, therapy with Delta9-THC should be tried. At present, it remains unclear whether herbal cannabis, different natural or synthetic cannabinoid CB1-receptor agonists or agents that interfere with the inactivation of endocannabinoids, may have the best adverse effect profile in TS.","Cannabinoids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Humans, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome, Tourette Syndrome/*drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

Many current treatment options have not been tested for their effect on pain. Previous research has been guided more by the ability of these treatments to increase functional abilities.

DESIGN: A prospective and randomized study. SETTING: A university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Investigation of two comparable groups of cardiac patients. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions were postoperative infusions of dobutamine, 7 micrograms/kg/min, and of insulin, 1.5 U/kg/h, respectively, over a period of 30 minutes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The effects of the interventions were measured using parameters relating to cardiac work and myocardial oxygen demand. Moreover, parameters relating to total body metabolism were also recorded. In the dobutamine group, cardiac index (CI) and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) increased significantly (p < 0.05) during therapy by 30% and 40%, respectively. Cardiac effort index (CEI) and tension time index (TTI) also increased (p < 0.05) during therapy by 41% and 30%, respectively. However, in the insulin group, CI and LVSWI also increased (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05) during therapy, although to a lesser extent (16% and 14%), but CEI and TTI did not change at all during therapy. Total body CO2 production (VCO2) and O2 consumption (VO2) in the dobutamine group increased (p < 0.05) during therapy by 9% and 11%, respectively, whereas in the insulin group only CO2 production increased (p < 0.05) by 13%. O2 consumption remained unchanged in this group. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that dobutamine as well as insulin administration increase cardiac performance. However, in contrast to dobutamine, insulin does not appear to increase myocardial oxygen demand. Therefore, the anabolic insulin administration may represent a more economic pattern of energy-consuming hemodynamic intervention than does the catabolic catecholamine administration.","Adult, Aged, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Carbon Dioxide/metabolism, Cardiac Output/drug effects, Cardiotonic Agents/*therapeutic use, *Coronary Artery Bypass, Dobutamine/*therapeutic use, Energy Metabolism/*drug effects, Heart/*drug effects, Heart Rate/drug effects, Hemodynamics/drug effects, Humans, Hypoglycemic Agents/*therapeutic use, Infusions, Intravenous, Insulin/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Myocardial Contraction/drug effects, Myocardium/*metabolism, Oxygen Consumption/*drug effects, Prospective Studies, Stroke Volume/drug effects, Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects",-1

10866910,Gabapentin enhances the analgesic effect of morphine in healthy volunteers.,"Eckhardt K, Ammon S, Hofmann U, Riebe A, Gugeler N, Mikus G",Anesth Analg. 2000 Jul;91(1):185-91.,"The most effective group of drugs for the treatment of severe pain is opioid analgesics. Their use, however, is limited by decreased effects in neuropathic and chronic pain as a result of increased pain and development of tolerance. Gabapentin (GBP) is effective in both experimental models of chronic pain and clinical studies of neuropathic pain. Therefore, we investigated, in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction of GBP and morphine in 12 healthy male volunteers. Morphine (60 mg, controlled release) or placebo was administered at 8:00 AM, and GBP (600 mg) or placebo was administered at 10:00 AM, thus comparing the analgesic effect of placebo + GBP (600 mg) with placebo + placebo and morphine (60 mg) + GBP in comparison to morphine plus placebo by using the cold pressor test. The duration and intensity of the side effects were assessed by using visual analog scales. The analgesic effect was evaluated by the change in the area under the curve (h x %; 0% baseline before Medication 1) of pain tolerance. Placebo + GBP (18.9% x h, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.5 to 40.3) did not present any significant analgesic effect compared with placebo + placebo (4.7% x h, 95% CI: -16.7 to 26.1). A significant increase in pain tolerance was observed comparing the combination of morphine and GBP (75.5% x h, 95% CI: 54.0-96.9) with morphine + placebo (40.6% x h, 95% CI: 19. 2-62.0). The observed adverse events after placebo + GBP were not significantly different compared with placebo + placebo. Morphine + placebo led to the expected opioid-mediated side effects. They were significantly more pronounced compared with placebo + placebo but did not differ significantly compared with the combination of morphine + GBP. Concerning the pharmacokinetic variables of morphine and its glucuronides, no significant difference between morphine + placebo and morphine + GBP was observed, whereas the area under the curve of GBP (43.9 +/- 5.3 vs 63.4 +/- 16.2 microg. h(-1). mL(-1), P < 0.05) significantly increased, and apparent oral clearance (230.8 +/- 29.4 mL/min vs 178 +/- 97.9 mL/min, P = 0.06) and apparent renal clearance (86.9 +/- 20.6 vs 73.0 +/- 24.2 mL/min, P = 0.067) of GBP decreased when morphine was administered concomitantly. These results suggest two different sites for the pharmacokinetic interaction-one at the level of absorption and the other at the level of elimination. Our study reveals both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between morphine and GBP, leading to an increased analgesic effect of morphine + GBP. These results and the good tolerability of GBP should favor clinical trials investigating the clinical relevance of the combination of morphine and GBP for treating severe pain. IMPLICATIONS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial with 12 healthy volunteers, we studied the interaction of morphine and gabapentin using the cold pressor test. The anticonvulsant gabapentin enhanced the acute analgesic effect of morphine. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of gabapentin was increased when morphine was administered concomitantly. Therefore, the well tolerated combination of gabapentin and morphine may improve pain therapy, especially in pain states, like chronic and neuropathic pain, which respond poorly to opioids.","Acetates/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology, *Amines, *Analgesia, Analgesics/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics, Area Under Curve, Cross-Over Studies, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Drug Synergism, Humans, Male, Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology, Pain Threshold, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
10443094,The relationship between myofascial trigger points of gastrocnemius muscle and nocturnal calf cramps.,"Prateepavanich P, Kupniratsaikul V, Charoensak T",J Med Assoc Thai. 1999 May;82(5):451-9.,"To support that myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) of gastrocnemius muscle is one cause of nocturnal calf cramps, quantitative assessment of the efficacy of trigger point (TrP) injection compared with oral quinine in the treatment of nocturnal calf cramps (NCC) associated with MPS of gastrocnemius muscle was designed. Twenty four subjects with NCC and gastrocnemius TrPs were randomly divided into two groups of twelve for each treatment. Patients in group 1 were treated with xylocaine injection at the gastrocnemius TrP, and 300 mg of quinine sulfate p.o. was prescribed for patients of group 2. The treatment period was four weeks with a follow-up 4 weeks later. Cramps were assessed quantitatively (in terms of frequency, duration, pain intensity, cramp index, and pain threshold of the gastrocnemius TrPs) before treatment, after treatment and at the end of the follow-up respectively. The outcome of treatment in both groups showed a statistically significant reduction in all quantitative aspects of cramps (95% confidence interval). Also the pain threshold of the gastrocnemius TrP was significantly increased in group 1 only when comparing the pre-treatment and at the end of follow-up. In comparing the two groups we found no statistical difference during the period of treatment. The benefit of both strategies lasted up to four weeks following cessation of the treatment but the outcome of all measures (except pain threshold) were found to be significantly better in the group treated with TrP injection. The results of this study support that gastrocnemius trigger point is one cause of NCC and show that the TrP injection strategy for NCC associated with myofascial pain is not only as effective as oral quinine during the treatment period but also better in the prolonged effect at follow-up.","Aged, Analysis of Variance, Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Circadian Rhythm, Female, Humans, Injections, Intramuscular, Leg, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/drug therapy/*etiology, Muscle, Skeletal, Myofascial Pain Syndromes/*complications/drug therapy, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome",-1

Seventy-five patients with FM were randomly allocated to active gallium-arsenide (Ga-As) laser (25 patients), placebo laser (25 patients), and amitriptyline therapy (25 patients). All groups were evaluated for the improvement in pain, number of tender points, skin fold tenderness, morning stiffness, sleep disturbance, muscular spasm, and fatigue. Depression was evaluated by a psychiatrist according to the Hamilton Depression Rate Scale and DSM IV criteria. Quality of life of the FM patients was assessed according to the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). In the laser group, patients were treated for 3 min at each tender point daily for 2 weeks, except weekends, at each point with approximately 2 J/cm(2) using a Ga-As laser. The same unit was used for the placebo treatment, for which no laser beam was emitted. Patients in the amitriptyline group took 10 mg daily at bedtime throughout the 8 weeks. Significant improvements were indicated in all clinical parameters in the laser group (P = 0.001) and significant improvements were indicated in all clinical parameters except fatigue in the amitriptyline group (P = 0.000), whereas significant improvements were indicated in pain (P = 0.000), tender point number (P = 0.001), muscle spasm (P = 0.000), morning stiffness (P = 0.002), and FIQ score (P = 0.042) in the placebo group. A significant difference was observed in clinical parameters such as pain intensity (P = 0.000) and fatigue (P = 0.000) in favor of the laser group over the other groups, and a significant difference was observed in morning stiffness (P = 0.001), FIQ (P = 0.003), and depression score (P = 0.000) after therapy. A significant difference was observed in morning stiffness (P = 0.001), FIQ (P = 0.003), and depression (P = 0.000) in the amitriptyline group compared to the placebo group after therapy. Additionally, a significant difference was observed in depression score (P = 0.000) in the amitriptyline group in comparison to the laser group after therapy. Our study suggests that both amitriptyline and laser therapies are effective on clinical symptoms and QOL in fibromyalgia and that Ga-As laser therapy is a safe and effective treatment in cases with FM. Additionally, the present study suggests that the Ga-As laser therapy can be used as a monotherapy or as a supplementary treatment to other therapeutic procedures in FM.","Adult, Amitriptyline/*administration & dosage, Analysis of Variance, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy/physiopathology/*radiotherapy, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Laser Therapy, Low-Level/*methods, Male, Pain Measurement, Placebos, *Quality of Life, Reference Values, Severity of Illness Index, Single-Blind Method, Statistics, Nonparametric, Treatment Outcome, Turkey",-1

METHODS: Data on 284 patients with pheochromocytoma observed between 1978 and 1997 were collected from 18 Italian centers through a questionnaire reporting epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological and surgical data. RESULTS: 53.6% of the patients were females and 46.4% were males. Thirty-two tumors were discovered as incidental adrenal masses. The most frequent referred symptoms were palpitations (58.1%), headache (51.9%), sweating (48. 8%) and anxiety (35.3%). Their association was present only in 15.5% of patients. Paroxysmal symptoms were reported in 67.1% and hypertensive crises in 59.7% of patients. Normal blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) was present both in the supine and upright positions in 21.1% of patients. Among laboratory assays, urinary vanylmandelic acid (VMA) was the most widely used (58.1%) and was the least sensitive (25% of false negative results). Basal plasma catecholamines were found to be normal in 11.3% of patients but were always elevated when sampled during a hypertensive paroxysm. A clonidine suppression test was performed in 38 patients with no adverse side effects. It gave a false negative response in 2 patients. A glucagon test was performed in 21 patients. It was interrupted for acute hypertension in 52.4% of patients. Only 5/21 patients were normotensive and had normal basal plasma catecholamines. In these patients the test gave a positive response in four (80%). CT (79.6%) and I-MIBG scintigraphy (68.5%) were the most widely used methods for tumor localization. CT sensitivity was 98.9% for intra-adrenal and 90.9% for extra-adrenal tumors. MIBG sensitivity was 88.5%. In the 263 patients who underwent surgery, the tumor was intra-adrenal in 89.4%, extra-adrenal in 8.5%, intra- and extra-adrenal in 2.1%, and bilateral in 11.0% of patients. Malignancy was reported in 9.9% of cases. Surgery caused remission of hypertension in 59.3%, improvement in 26.8%, and no changes in 13. 9% of patients. In the last group the interval between initial symptoms and diagnosis was significantly longer. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that the clinical presentation of pheochromocytoma is variable and aspecific. Normotension is often present and often the tumor is discovered incidentally. An indication for the routine use of screening methods more sensitive than urinary VMA is strongly suggested. The clonidine test was found to be safe and should be preferred to the glucagon test which has to be restricted to very selected patients. CT and MIBG scintigraphy are almost always successful in localizing the tumor. Reversal of hypertension by surgery seems to depend on an early diagnosis.","Adolescent, Adrenal Gland Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/surgery, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Child, Clonidine/diagnostic use, Epinephrine/blood/urine, Female, Glucagon/diagnostic use, Humans, Hypertension, Italy/epidemiology, Male, Middle Aged, Norepinephrine/blood/urine, Pheochromocytoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology/surgery, Posture, Retrospective Studies, Vanilmandelic Acid/urine",-1

11543693,Neuroendocrine and immune aspects of fibromyalgia.,"van West D, Maes M",BioDrugs. 2001;15(8):521-31.,"Fibromyalgia is a form of non-articular rheumatism characterised by long term (>3 months) and widespread musculoskeletal aching, stiffness and pressure hyperalgesia at characteristic soft tissue sites, called soft tissue tender points. The biophysiology of fibromyalgia, however, has remained elusive and the treatment remains mainly empirical. This article reviews the neuroendocrine-immune pathophysiology of fibromyalgia. There is no major evidence that fibromyalgia is accompanied by activation of the inflammatory response system, by immune activation or by an inflammatory process. There is some evidence that fibromyalgia is accompanied by some signs of immunosuppression, suggesting that immunomodifying drugs could have potential in the treatment of fibromyalgia. Recent trials with cytokines, such as interferon-alpha, have been undertaken in patients with fibromyalgia. Immunotherapy with these agents, however, may induce symptoms reminiscent of fibromyalgia and depression in a considerable number of patients. Lowered serum activity of prolyl endopeptidase (PEP), a cytosolic endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of proline in proteins of relatively small molecular mass, may play a role in the biophysiology of fibromyalgia through diminished inactivation of algesic and depression-related peptides, e.g. substance P. Trials with PEP agonists could be worthwhile in fibromyalgia. The muscle energy depletion hypothesis of fibromyalgia is supported by findings that this condition is accompanied by lowered plasma levels of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), i.e. valine, leucine and isoleucine. Since there is evidence that BCAA supplementation decreases muscle catabolism and has ergogenic values, a supplemental trial with BCAAs in fibromyalgia appears to be justified.","Animals, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, Fibromyalgia/drug therapy/*immunology/*metabolism, Humans, Inflammation/immunology/metabolism, Neurosecretory Systems/*immunology/metabolism, Serotonin/*metabolism, Tryptophan/metabolism",-1

Patients received individualized rehabilitation and were followed up to 24 months. The primary outcome measures were the Ashworth Scale and the functional skills and caregiver assistance scales of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). Ashworth Scale scores were significantly reduced (P < or = .0005). All areas of functional skills and caregiver assistance improved. Comparing groups of adults and patients less than 18 years, there were no significant differences, but there was a relationship between age and dose. Comparing groups of patients in high and low levels of independent functional mobility, no significant differences were found. These results provide suggestive evidence that the combination of intrathecal baclofen therapy and rehabilitation has positive effects across the dimensions of disablement. This study serves as a basis for high-level scientific studies of these effects.","Activities of Daily Living/*classification, Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Cerebral Palsy/*drug therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Disability Evaluation, Female, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy, Neurologic Examination/*drug effects, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), Physical Therapy Modalities",-1

8621203,Alpha 2-adrenergic agonists increase cellular lactate efflux.,"Lockette W, Kirkland K, Farrow S",Hypertension. 1996 May;27(5):1104-7.,"We reported previously that genetic polymorphisms of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor are associated with hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension in blacks. The evolutionary driving force for maintaining such deleterious mutations in the black population is unknown. Recognizing that vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors mediate cold-induced vasoconstriction and that temperature maintenance is a primary thrust of cellular metabolism, we postulated that vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors contribute significantly to metabolic heat generation in homeotherms such as humans. Using aerobic lactate production as an indicator of thermogenesis, we measured metabolic heat production in HT29 cells that expressed the gene encoding human vascular alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine, an alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonist, increased net lactate efflux from 226 +/- 20 to 280 +/- 20 nmol/min (mean +/- SE) (P = .06). Clonidine, a more specific alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, increased lactate efflux from 110 +/- 6 to 156 +/- 8 nmol/min (P < .01). Similarly, in the presence of physiological concentrations of glucose (5.5 mmol/L), insulin increased lactate production from 123 +/- 6 to 175 +/- 10 nmol/min (P < .01). Because differences in aerobic glycolysis may also explain the heat intolerance and abnormal fuel homeostasis found in genetically hypertensive rats, we also measured lactate production in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) and normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Vascular smooth muscle cells from SHRSP had significantly greater lactate efflux compared with cells from normotensive WKY (296 +/- 4 versus 172 +/- 2 nmol/min, P < .001). These differences were not due to abnormalities in glucose uptake, as lactate efflux was greater in SHRSP cells compared with WKY cells when dextrose was replaced with equimolar concentrations of fructose (230 +/- 6 versus 138 +/- 2 nmol/min, P < .001). alpha 2-Adrenergic agonists increase lactate efflux in HT29 cells, and abnormalities in vascular smooth muscle lactate metabolism in genetically hypertensive rats is independent of altered glucose uptake. These data provide support for our hypothesis that balanced polymorphisms of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor could offer protection against cold stress by increasing the thermogenic response associated with aerobic lactate production.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*pharmacology, Animals, Body Temperature Regulation, Cells, Cultured, Cerebrovascular Disorders/genetics, Clonidine/pharmacology, Epinephrine/pharmacology, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Insulin/pharmacology, Lactates/*metabolism, Lactic Acid, Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/metabolism, Rats, Rats, Inbred SHR/genetics, Rats, Inbred WKY",-1

STUDY DESIGN: Population-based retrospective case-control study. SUBJECTS: 584 male patients served by a Veterans Affairs SCI service. MEASURES: Medical records were reviewed for sleep apnea diagnosis, demographic information, neurologic characteristics, and treatments received. Sleep study reports were not available to determine the nature of abnormal respiratory events (ie central, obstructive, hypoventilation). For each case with tetraplegia, a control tetraplegic subject without sleep apnea diagnosis was selected. RESULTS: We identified 53 subjects with diagnosed sleep apnea: 42 tetraplegic, 11 paraplegic. This represented 14.9% of all tetraplegic and 3.7% of all paraplegic patients in the population (P<0.0001 for comparison of tetraplegic and paraplegic proportions). In tetraplegic subjects, sleep apnea was associated with obesity and more rostral motor level, but not with ASIA Impairment Scale. Medical comorbidities associated with sleep apnea in non-SCI patients, such as hypertension, were more common in case subjects. Less than half of case subjects were receiving some form of treatment. For motor-complete tetraplegics, long-term positive airway pressure treatment was less common with motor level C5 and above compared to C6 and below. CONCLUSION: In this population, sleep apnea has been frequently diagnosed, particularly in tetraplegic subjects. The true prevalence is likely to be considerably higher, since this study considered only previously diagnosed cases. Sleep apnea was associated with obesity and higher neurologic level, but not ASIA Impairment Scale. Medical comorbidities were more frequent in this group, and treatment acceptance was poor with higher level motor-complete injuries. Since the type of sleep apnea (central or obstructive) was not distinguished, we cannot comment on the prevalence and associations based on specific types of sleep apnea.","Adult, Age Distribution, Aged, Case-Control Studies, Comorbidity, Humans, Incidence, Injury Severity Score, Logistic Models, Male, Middle Aged, Paraplegia/epidemiology, Quadriplegia/epidemiology, Reference Values, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Sleep Apnea Syndromes/diagnosis/*epidemiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/diagnosis/*epidemiology/surgery, Statistics, Nonparametric",-1

12938867,The diverse roles of anticonvulsants in bipolar disorders.,"Ketter TA, Wang PW, Becker OV, Nowakowska C, Yang YS",Ann Clin Psychiatry. 2003 Jun;15(2):95-108.,"Anticonvulsant drugs (ACs) have diverse antiseizure, psychotropic, and biochemical effects. Carbamazepine and valproate have mood-stabilizing actions, benzodiazepines and gabapentin have anxiolytic actions, lamotrigine is useful in rapid cycling and acute treatment and prophylaxis of bipolar depression, and topiramate and zonisamide can yield weight loss. Limited controlled data suggest the carbamazepine keto derivative oxcarbazepine has antimanic effects. A categorical approach to the diverse roles of ACs in bipolar disorders is proposed, using broad categories of ACs, on the basis of their predominant psychotropic profiles. Thus, some ACs have ""sedating"" profiles that may include sedation, cognitive difficulties, fatigue, weight gain, and possibly antimanic and/or anxiolytic effects. In contrast, some newer ACs have ""activating"" profiles that may include improved energy, weight loss, and possibly antidepressant and even anxiogenic effects. Still other newer ACs have novel ""mixed"" profiles, combining sedation and weight loss. A categorical-mechanistic extension of this approach is also presented, with hypotheses that ""sedating"" profiles might be related to prominent potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission, ""activating"" profiles could be related to prominent attenuation of glutamate excitatory neurotransmission, and for ""mixed"" profiles, sedation and weight loss might be related to concurrent GABAergic and antiglutamatergic actions, respectively. The categorical approach may have utility as an aid to clinicians in reinforcing the heterogeneity ACs, and recalling psychotropic profiles of individual ACs, but is limited as it fails to address the etiology of the heterogeneity of AC psychotropic effects. The categorical-mechanistic extension strives to address this issue, but requires systematic clinical investigation of more precise relationships between psychotropic profiles and discrete mechanisms of action to assess its merits.","Affect/drug effects, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/metabolism/psychology, Brain/drug effects/metabolism, Humans, Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism, Treatment Outcome",-1
8536305,Efficacy of transdermal clonidine in short-term treatment of cluster headache: a pilot study.,"D'Andrea G, Perini F, Granella F, Cananzi A, Sergi A",Cephalalgia. 1995 Oct;15(5):430-3.,"Some clinical as well as pharmacological indications seem to suggest that a reduction of the noradrenergic tone occurs in cluster headache (CH), during both the active and remission periods. But sharp fluctuations of the sympathetic system may trigger the attacks. Clonidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic presynaptic agonist, regulates the sympathetic tone in the central nervous system. Therefore, a continuous administration of low-dose clonidine could be potentially beneficial in the active phase of CH by antagonizing the variations in noradrenergic tone. After a run-in week, we administered transdermal clonidine (5 - 7.5 mg) for one week to 13 patients suffering from CH, either episodic (8 cases) or chronic (5 cases). During clonidine treatment, the mean weekly frequency of attacks dropped from 17.7 +/- 7.0 to 8.7 +/- 6.6 (p = 0.0005), the pain intensity of attacks measured on the visual analogue scale from 98.0 +/- 7.2 to 41.1 +/- 36.1 mm (p = 0.001), and the duration from 59.3 +/- 21.9 to 34.3 +/- 24.6 min (p = 0.02). This open pilot study strongly suggests that transdermal clonidine may be an effective drug in the preventive treatment of CH. Its efficacy is possibly due to its central sympatho-inhibition, which reduces or prevents the occurrence of fluctuations of noradrenaline release that may induce the attacks.","Administration, Cutaneous, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Adult, Clonidine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Cluster Headache/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain Measurement, Pilot Projects",-1

10344609,Management of toenail onychomycosis.,"Tom CM, Kane MP",Am J Health Syst Pharm. 1999 May 1;56(9):865-71.,"The treatment of toenail onychomycosis is reviewed. Onychomycosis contributes to 40% of all nail disorders and appears to be increasing in frequency. Mycotic nail infections are usually caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and nondermatophyte molds. Most cases of toenail onychomycosis are caused by dermatophytes. Mycotic nail infections do not always resolve spontaneously and may have a substantial impact on the patient's quality of life. Current treatment modalities for onychomycosis include surgery, topical antifungals, and oral antifungals. Surgery is generally not recommended as first-line therapy. Broad-spectrum topical and oral antifungal agents are the most frequently used treatments. Topical treatment is well tolerated but is usually not effective because of poor patient compliance and inadequate penetration of the nail. Oral antifungals are more successful but carry greater risks. Griseofulvin and ketoconazole have been oral antifungals traditionally used for onychomycosis, but these agents are associated with relatively low cure rates. Itraconazole and terbinafine are both safe and effective first-line agents, with reported overall cure rates of 50-90% for dermatophyte-related onychomycosis. Intermittent oral antifungal therapy may reduce the risk of systemic adverse effects and the cost of therapy; more study of this approach is needed. Oral antifungal agents offer patients with toenail onychomycosis greater likelihood of a cure than topical antifungals, but oral therapy carries greater risks and requires closer monitoring.","Administration, Oral, Administration, Topical, Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Itraconazole/therapeutic use, Naphthalenes/therapeutic use, Onychomycosis/diagnosis/economics/epidemiology/*therapy, Toes/*microbiology",-1

It was brought back to Europe by the Jesuit priests and used in error to treat all types of fever. Because of its cost and lack of availability, apothecaries found an alternative antipyretic in willow bark. Subsequently salicylates were isolated from willow and quinine from cinchona bark. Quinine is used worldwide for the treatment of fever due to malaria, but in the Western environment has long been used for muscle cramps because of its neuro muscular junction blocking action. DISCUSSION: Quinine is a widely used medication which has been reported to cause thrombocytopenia on occasion. This potentially life threatening complication should be borne in mind when it is prescribed for minor symptoms such as muscle cramps.","Drug Eruptions/*etiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects, Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/*chemically induced, Quinine/*adverse effects",-1

These mainly concern the physiology and pathophysiology of the aging stomach, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of antisecretory drugs, and the presence of different risk factors from those in patients under 60 years of age. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of the present-day clinical and pharmacological knowledge concerning the use of antisecretory drugs [histamine H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors] in the treatment of peptic ulcer in the elderly, taking into account the pathogenetic role of Helicobacter pylori. The available data from controlled trials show that the clinical efficacy and safety of short and long term antisecretory treatment for peptic ulcer are similar in elderly and younger patients. In addition, there are no significant differences between H2RAs and proton pump inhibitors. In particular, in patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric or duodenal ulcer, H2RAs and omeprazole have proved useful even when NSAID therapy is continued.

Recent studies have emphasized that lacrimal and salivary gland flow involves an entire ""functional"" unit that includes the mucosal surface (the site of inflammation), efferent nerve signals sent to the midbrain (lacrimatory and salvatory nucleus), efferent neural signals from the brain, and acinal/ductal structures in the gland. Thus, symptoms of dryness or pain can result from interferences with any part of this functional unit. The initiating antigens in SS remain unknown, but immune reactivity against SS-A, SS-B, fodrin, alpha- amylase, and carbonic anhydrase have been demonstrated in patients with established disease. The inflammatory process in the gland releases metalloproteinases that alter the relationship of epithelial cells to their matrix, an interaction that is necessary for glandular function and survival. Therapies for SS remain inadequate. In SS patients with immune-mediated extraglandular manifestation (ie, lung, kidney, skin, nerve), the therapeutic approach is similar to systemic lupus erythematosus, although these therapies have relatively little effect on tear or saliva flow.","Humans, Models, Biological, Seroepidemiologic Studies, Sjogren's Syndrome/*diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/therapy",-1

A meta-analysis and review.,"Arnold LM, Keck PE Jr, Welge JA",Psychosomatics. 2000 Mar-Apr;41(2):104-13.,"Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain disorder associated with mood disorders. Antidepressants, particularly tricyclics, are commonly recommended treatments. Randomized, controlled trials of antidepressants for treatment of fibromyalgia were reviewed by methodology, results, and potential predictors of response. Twenty-one controlled trials, 16 involving tricyclic agents, were identified; 9 of these 16 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calculated for measurements of physician and patient overall assessment, pain, stiffness, tenderness, fatigue, and sleep quality. Compared with placebo, tricyclic agents were associated with effect sizes that were substantially larger than zero for all measurements. The largest improvement was associated with measures of sleep quality; the most modest improvement was found in measures of stiffness and tenderness. Further studies are needed utilizing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel designs with antidepressants administered at therapeutic dose ranges, using standardized criteria for fibromyalgia and systematically assessed for co-occurring psychiatric illness.","Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/psychology, Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy/psychology, Humans, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Sick Role, Treatment Outcome",-1
10557122,The psychological effects of spinal cord injury: a review.,North NT,Spinal Cord. 1999 Oct;37(10):671-9.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually necessitates considerable changes in the life of an individual, and their family members. SCI may demand difficult psychological adjustment and in addition place great strain on family roles and relationships. Glass (1993) summarises the situation thus: 'The experience of spinal cord injury is one of the most devastating injuries which might affect an individual. The resultant disability, after which normal cognitive function and intellectual ability usually remains, produces not only an inability to move and feel limbs, but also the inability to control the function of internal organs and even, in severe cases, the ability to breathe independently.'1","Humans, Spinal Cord Injuries/*psychology",-1

The North American Diastat Study Group.,"Cereghino JJ, Mitchell WG, Murphy J, Kriel RL, Rosenfeld WE, Trevathan E",Neurology. 1998 Nov;51(5):1274-82.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a single-dose treatment for acute repetitive seizure (ARS) episodes (e.g., clusters) administered in a nonmedical setting by caregivers. BACKGROUND: Patients with epilepsy may experience ARS episodes despite optimal anticonvulsant treatment. Such episodes require rapid treatment as medical emergencies. Typically, the patient is treated in an emergency medical setting with i.v. medication by trained medical personnel. METHODS: The authors undertook a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind study of a single administration of Diastat (diazepam rectal gel) for treating episodes of ARS. ARS episodes and treatment criteria were defined for each patient at the start of the study. Caregivers were taught to determine ARS episode onset, administer a predetermined dose of study medication, monitor outcome, count respirations, and record seizures and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 29 centers enrolled 158 patients, of whom 114 patients had a treated ARS episode (Diastat, n = 56; placebo, n = 58). Diastat treatment reduced median seizure frequency (p = 0.029). More Diastat patients were seizure free post-treatment (Diastat, 55%; placebo, 34%; p = 0.031). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the time to the next seizure favored Diastat treatment (p < 0.007). The most common adverse event was somnolence. CONCLUSION: Administration of a single rectal dose of Diastat was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the number of seizures following an episode of ARS. Caregivers could administer treatment safely and effectively in a nonmedical setting.","Acute Disease, Administration, Rectal, Adolescent, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Child, Diazepam/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Electroencephalography, Female, Gels, Humans, Male, Recurrence, Respiration, Seizures/*drug therapy/physiopathology",-1

11560197,Adjunctive agents in the management of chronic pain.,Guay DR,Pharmacotherapy. 2001 Sep;21(9):1070-81.,"Chronic pain syndromes include cancer-related pain, postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and central poststroke pain and are common in the elderly. Adjunctive (or adjuvant) analgesics, defined as drugs that do not contain acetaminophen and those not classified as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory or opioid agents, play a role in the management of chronic pain. The term ""adjunctive"" (or ""adjuvant"") is a misnomer as several of these agents may constitute first-line therapy for many chronic pain syndromes. Tricyclic antidepressants have formed the backbone of therapy for chronic neuropathic pain for years. However, the difficulty with using agents of this class, due to their clinically significant adverse-event potential, has led to the evaluation of other agents, most notably, the antiepileptic drugs. The most useful are gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine. In selected patients, baclofen, mexiletine, and clonidine may be useful as well. Cancer-related pain may respond substantially to corticosteroids, and pain associated with bone metastases to parenteral bisphosphonates and strontium. Practitioners should consider these alternative agents when treating chronic pain.","Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Animals, Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Humans, Neoplasms/complications, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use, Steroids, Sympatholytics/therapeutic use",-1

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the efficacy of antidepressants in the treatment of fibromyalgia and examine whether this effect was independent of depression. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Studies were obtained from searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PSYCLIT (1966-1999), the Cochrane Library, unpublished literature, and bibliographies. We performed independent duplicate review of each study for both inclusion and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen randomized, placebo-controlled trials were identified, of which 13 were appropriate for data extraction. There were 3 classes of antidepressants evaluated: tricyclics (9 trials), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3 trials), and S-adenosylmethionine (2 trials). Overall, the quality of the studies was good (mean score 5.6, scale 0-8). The odds ratio for improvement with therapy was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.6 to 6.8). The pooled risk difference for these studies was 0.25 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.34), which calculates to 4 (95% CI, 2.9 to 6.3) individuals needing treatment for 1 patient to experience symptom improvement. When the effect on individual symptoms was combined, antidepressants improved sleep, fatigue, pain, and well-being, but not trigger points. In the 5 studies where there was adequate assessment for an effect independent of depression, only 1 study found a correlation between symptom improvement and depression scores. Outcomes were not affected by class of agent or quality score using meta-regression. CONCLUSION: Antidepressants are efficacious in treating many of the symptoms of fibromyalgia. Patients were more than 4 times as likely to report overall improvement, and reported moderate reductions in individual symptoms, particularly pain. Whether this effect is independent of depression needs further study.","Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Depression/complications, Female, Fibromyalgia/classification/*drug therapy/psychology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",1
11429091,Combined motor disturbances following severe traumatic brain injury: an integrative long-term treatment approach.,"Keren O, Reznik J, Groswasser Z",Brain Inj. 2001 Jul;15(7):633-8.,"Patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer from residual impairments in motor control, communication skills, cognition and social behaviour. These distinctly hamper their capability to return to their 'pre-trauma' activity. Comprehensive and integrated rehabilitation programmes initiate, during the acute phase, a prolonged treatment process which starts at the most sophisticated medical systems. There is no clear end point for the treatment of these patients, since the recovery process and the rehabilitation activity may continue for years, even after patients return home to live with their families. The inherent inability to make a firm early prediction regarding outcome of patients and the late appearance of additional symptoms stress the need for a comprehensive close long-term follow-up. The following presentation concerns the description of the treatment strategy and long-term improvement of a 22-year-old male who suffered from very severe TBI. On admission to the emergency room, he was in the decerebrated position and his Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was at the lowest (3). The focus of this presentation is on the recovery of motor function. The initial motor disabilities included weakness in all four limbs, in particular left hemiplegia, and right hemiparesis with severe bilateral ataxic elements and a marked tremor of the right arm. Range of motion was limited in hips, and he suffered from stiff trunk and neck. Goals of physiotherapy were directed towards improving range of motion (ROM) and active movement. Casting, use of orthoses, biofeedback, hydrotherapy, hippotherapy, medication and nerve blocks for reducing spasticity were timely applied during the process. The motor improvement in this very severe TBI patient who is now over 3 years post-injury still continues and has a functional meaning. He has succeeded in being able to stand up by himself from a chair and is able to walk unaided and without orthoses for very short distances--up to five steps. He is able to drink soup without assistance and play a few notes on the piano. Marked cognitive improvement occurred as well. It is concluded that motor improvement may be evident over long periods of time and various timely interventions may assist in the process.","Activities of Daily Living, Adult, Biofeedback, Psychology, Brain Injuries/*complications/*rehabilitation, Casts, Surgical, Combined Modality Therapy, Humans, Hydrotherapy, Male, Motor Skills Disorders/*etiology/*rehabilitation, Nerve Block, Orthotic Devices, *Physical Therapy Modalities, Treatment Outcome, Walking",-1

Several strategies have been used to activate spinal cord circuitry independent of the higher centers, including direct electrical stimulation, pharmacological agents, and training programs that involve moving the legs through the motions of walking. Ambulatory leg movements are achieved by these interventions, leading to substantial functional improvements in the subset of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury. The neurobiological basis for these phenomena likely involves activity-dependent reconfiguration of synaptic connections within the spinal cord.

Therefore, they often perform their own ""informal"" tests of treatment effectiveness. Single patient (""N-of-1"") trials provide a structured design for more rigorous assessment of medical treatments of chronic diseases, but are applied only to the index patient. We present a hierarchical Bayesian random effects model to combine N-of-1 studies to obtain an estimate of treatment effectiveness for the population and to use this population information to aid in the evaluation of an individual patient's trial results. The model's treatment effect estimates are adjustments between the population estimate and the individual's observed results. This adjustment is based upon the within-patient and between-patient heterogeneity.

Children with cerebral palsy often have difficulty in mobility because of this form of spasticity. The purpose of this study was to assess the functional outcomes of intrathecal baclofen pump therapy with spasticity in children with cerebral palsy. A retrospective review of medical records for pediatric cerebral palsy patients receiving intrathecal baclofen for intractable spasticity was performed. Of 23 sequential medical records meeting requirements for inclusion in the study, 17 subjects had sufficient recorded data to be included in the study. Data from the medical records included Ashworth scores, therapy complications, and changes in mobility and independence. Although no significant changes in the upper extremities with intrathecal baclofen occurred at one and three months, the trial bolus showed statistically significant changes in mean Ashworth scores. The pre- and posttrial bolus Ashworth scores for the lower extremities showed statistically significant decreases in the posttrial scores and at one and three months when compared with the pretrial scores (p < .001). Complications were resolved with conservative management without long-term sequelae. No infections, respiratory depressions, or deaths occurred as a result of intrathecal baclofen therapy in this study. Although intrathecal baclofen had a significant effect in reducing lower extremity spasticity in children with cerebral palsy, further prospective studies are needed to determine the effects of intrathecal baclofen on such indicators as activities of daily living.","Adolescent, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Cerebral Palsy/*complications/*drug therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage, Muscle Spasticity/etiology, Retrospective Studies",-1

Adult patients with moderate to severe migraine initially received customary therapy for migraine episodes for 12 weeks, followed by 24 weeks' treatment with self-administered subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg. Demographic, baseline, health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction rating data were collected during visits to the clinic. Data relating to migraine symptoms, migraine therapy, work productivity and non-work activity time were collected on diary cards filled out by the patients. 749 patients were recruited to the study and 637 received at least 1 dose of sumatriptan. Overall, 75.5% of migraines were successfully treated within 2 hours with sumatriptan compared with 31.9% with customary therapy; 36% of patients reported complete relief at 2 hours with sumatriptan treatment compared with 1% of patients receiving customary therapy. 69% of patients successfully treated 70% of their migraines with sumatriptan within 2 hours, compared with 12% of patients with customary therapy. No serious adverse events were reported; 50% of patients reported an adverse event during the 12-week customary therapy phase and 89% of patients during the 24-week sumatriptan phase. These clinical results, which are consistent with those reported in randomised blinded studies of subcutaneous sumatriptan, suggest that relief of migraine symptoms occurs more often, and in less time, in patients receiving subcutaneous sumatriptan rather than customary therapy as their primary medication.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Female, Humans, Injections, Subcutaneous, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy, Prospective Studies, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/*administration & dosage, Sumatriptan/*administration & dosage/adverse effects",-1

Their effectiveness, cost and adverse-effect profiles differ. This paper sets out to estimate the cost effectiveness of each drug, and the impact of changing from baclofen to tizanidine. DESIGN: A simplified but realistic model of physician behaviour and patient response was developed as a decision tree and populated with data derived from the available published clinical comparative trials. We considered patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. The outcome measure used was 'cost per successfully treated day' (STD). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service at 2000 values. RESULTS: Expected cost for a cohort of 100 patients over 1 year was estimated to be pound 181 545 with baclofen and pound 211 930 with tizanidine. The estimated number of STDs was 20,192 with tizanidine and 17,289 with baclofen. The overall cost effectiveness of managing spasticity using baclofen and tizanidine was very similar ( pound 10.50 and pound 10.49 per STD respectively). The incremental cost effectiveness (ICE) of using tinzanidine as an alternative to baclofen for first-line treatment was pound 10.47 per STD. Sensitivity analysis found the model to be robust to changes in key parameters CONCLUSION: Drug cost should not be a determining factor in making this treatment choice, as the cost effectiveness ratios are similar for both products.","Baclofen/*economics/*therapeutic use, Clonidine/*analogs & derivatives/*economics/*therapeutic use, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Great Britain, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*economics/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*economics/physiopathology",-1
11481148,Treatment advances for cocaine-induced ischemic stroke: focus on dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists.,"Johnson BA, Devous MD Sr, Ruiz P, Ait-Daoud N",Am J Psychiatry. 2001 Aug;158(8):1191-8.,"OBJECTIVE: The authors reviewed the pathogenesis of cocaine-related cerebral ischemia, appraised current knowledge of its sequelae, and assessed the role of putative therapeutic agents, particularly dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists. METHOD: The authors performed an OVID-based literature review of all indexed journals between 1966 and 2000. RESULTS: Cocaine abuse significantly increases the risk of ischemic stroke. The principal mechanism of cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia is vasospasm of large cranial arteries or within the cortical microvasculature. Increased levels of extracellular monoamines, particularly dopamine, mediate vasospasm. Neuroanatomical and labeling studies also have shown that dopamine-innervated neurons may regulate cerebral blood flow. Indeed, dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Neuroimaging studies show that cocaine-induced hypoperfusion can persist even after 6 months of abstinence. Hypoperfusion can result in deficits on complex and simple psychomotor tasks but perhaps not on memory or attention. Severe cerebral ischemia can directly precipitate neuronal death and degradation, a condition exacerbated by liberation of the excitatory amino acid glutamate. Dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists inhibit cocaine-mediated dopamine release on neurons involved in vasospasm and the control of cortical circulation. Other causes of cerebral ischemia include thrombogenesis and vasculitis. Although antithrombotic agents have potential in alleviating cocaine's neurotoxic effects, their use may be limited by the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine abuse can result in stroke, neuroischemia, and cognitive deficits that can persist even after prolonged abstinence. Dihydropyridine-class calcium channel antagonists, such as isradipine, show promise as therapeutic agents for preventing cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia.","Brain Ischemia/diagnosis/*etiology/*prevention & control, Calcium Channel Blockers/*therapeutic use, Cocaine-Related Disorders/*complications, Dihydropyridines/*therapeutic use, Humans, Isradipine/therapeutic use, Stroke/diagnosis/*etiology/*prevention & control, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, Vasospasm, Intracranial/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology",-1
11860611,Reliability of race assessment based on the race of the ascendants: a cross-sectional study.,"Fuchs SC, Guimaraes SM, Sortica C, Wainberg F, Dias KO, Ughini M, Castro JA, Fuchs FD",BMC Public Health. 2002;2:1. Epub 2002 Jan 16.,"BACKGROUND: Race is commonly described in epidemiological surveys based on phenotypic characteristics. Training of interviewers to identify race is time-consuming and self identification of race might be difficult to interpret. The aim of this study was to determine the agreement between race definition based on the number of ascendants with black skin colour, with the self-assessment and observer's assessment of the skin colour. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study of 50 women aged 14 years or older, from an outpatient clinic of an University affiliated hospital, race was assessed through observation and the self-assignment of the colour of skin and by the number of black ascendants including parents and grandparents. Reliability was measured through Kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Agreement beyond chance between self-assigned and observed skin colour was excellent for white (0.75 95% CI 0.72-0.78) and black women (0.89 95% CI 0.71-0.79), but only good for participants with mixed colour (0.61 95% CI 0.58-0.64), resulting in a global kappa of 0.75 (95% CI 0.71-0.79). However, only a good agreement for mixed women was obtained. The presence of 3 or more black ascendants was highly associated with observed and self-assessed black skin colour. Most women self-assigned or observed as white had no black ascendants. CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of race based on the race of ascendants showed reasonable agreement with the ascertainment done by trained interviewers and with the self-report of race. This method may be considered for evaluation of race in epidemiological surveys, since it is less time-consuming than the evaluation by interviewers.","Adolescent, Adult, African Americans/*classification, African Continental Ancestry Group, Aged, Brazil, Color, Continental Population Groups/*classification, Cross-Sectional Studies, Epidemiologic Studies, European Continental Ancestry Group/*classification, Female, Hospitals, Teaching/utilization, Humans, Middle Aged, *Observation, Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/utilization, *Pedigree, Questionnaires, Reproducibility of Results, *Self-Assessment, Skin",-1

12400247,Central pain: an overview.,"Devulder J, Crombez E, Mortier E",Acta Neurol Belg. 2002 Sep;102(3):97-103.,"Central pain is a particular form of neuropathic pain. Due to lesions in the spinothalamocortical pathways, ectopic neuronal discharges can occur into different neurons of the spinal cord and brain. Functional MRI, and positron emission tomography might be able to visualize ongoing pain activity which is, sometimes the consequence of spinothalamocortical lesions. Sometimes the patient experiences a burning ice-like sensation. This is more frequent in spinal cord lesions than in brain injuries. Some adrenergic, gabergic neurotransmitters, glycine, prostanoids and glutamate may play a role in pain transmission. These transmitters can induce changes in the neuronal membrane potential. Consequently, amitriptyline as an adrenergic reuptake inhibitor and the sodium channel blockers are the drugs of first-choice. A test procedure with placebo, opioids, lignocaine, propofol and ketamine might give some insight into advanced drug treatment. If oral or transdermal drug delivery is not indicated or ineffective, the intrathecal administration route can be attempted with baclofen, clonidine, opioids and midazolam. Invasive electrostimulation is the last treatment option. Thalamic stimulation can be tried in spinal cord injuries, and sensory motor cortex stimulation is sometimes the last resort for brain lesions associated with pain.","Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Animals, Autonomic Nerve Block, Brain Diseases/complications, Central Nervous System Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Electric Stimulation Therapy, Humans, Pain/*etiology/*physiopathology, *Pain Management, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications",-1

12720598,Complex regional pain syndrome: a review of evidence-supported treatment options.,"Hord ED, Oaklander AL",Curr Pain Headache Rep. 2003 Jun;7(3):188-96.,"Complex regional pain syndrome consists of pain and other symptoms that are unexpectedly severe or protracted after an injury. In type II complex regional pain syndrome, major nerve injury, often with motor involvement, is the cause; in complex regional pain syndrome I, the culprit is a more occult lesion, often a lesser injury that predominantly affects unmyelinated axons. In florid form, disturbances of vasoregulation (eg, edema) and abnormalities of other innervated tissues (skin, muscle, bone) can appear. Because of these various symptoms and the difficulty in identifying causative lesions, complex regional pain syndrome is difficult to treat or cure. Complex regional pain syndrome has not been systematically investigated; there are few controlled treatment trials for established complex regional pain syndrome. This article reviews the existing studies (even if preliminary) to direct clinicians toward the best options. Treatments for other neuropathic pain syndromes that may be efficacious for complex regional pain syndrome also are discussed. Some common treatments (eg, local anesthetic blockade of sympathetic ganglia) are not supported by the aggregate of published studies and should be used less frequently. Other treatments with encouraging published results (eg, neural stimulators) are not used often enough. We hope to encourage clinicians to rely more on evidence-supported treatments for complex regional pain syndrome.","Complex Regional Pain Syndromes/physiopathology/*therapy, *Evidence-Based Medicine, Humans",-1

The strategies for prevention and treatment are presented. AETIOLOGY: Among the various factors contributing to the occurrence of shoulder pain in hemiplegia, some are related to the joint, such as lesion of the rotator cuff tendons, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, inferior-anterior subluxation of the head of the humerus, whereas others are related to the neurologic lesion such as central post-stroke pain, lack of sensibility, unilateral neglect and spasticity. PREVENTION: Efforts should be made from the start to keep the shoulder in an ideal position at all times and movement of the shoulder and upper limb should be carried out with care. TREATMENT: Will be aimed to the cause of pain and passive or active range of motion exercises will be encouraged. Physical, medical and surgical treatments have improved over the last few decades. Functional electrical stimulation in patients with shoulder pain and subluxation, applied early after onset of the stroke, has shown beneficial positive effects on subluxation, pain and mobility. Efforts should therefore be made to better understand the post-stroke shoulder pain in order to provide better outcomes of rehabilitation and thus improve quality of life for patients.","Electric Stimulation Therapy/*methods, Female, Hemiplegia/*complications, Humans, Male, Muscle Spasticity, Pain Measurement, Physical Therapy Modalities/methods, Prognosis, Range of Motion, Articular/physiology, Severity of Illness Index, Shoulder Dislocation/etiology/physiopathology/*rehabilitation, Shoulder Pain/etiology/physiopathology/*rehabilitation, Stroke/complications, Treatment Outcome",-1

RESULTS: Five of the six patients experienced intolerable exacerbation of parkinsonism. Four subsequently did well on clozapine therapy. One patient required nursing home placement and a feeding gastrostomy as a result of the worsening parkinsonism during risperidone treatment, but was able to return home and have the gastrostomy removed after switching from risperidone to clozapine. Two of the five patients who worsened motorically also developed encephalopathy during risperidone treatment; the encephalopathy resolved when the patients were switched to clozapine treatment. Only one patient, the youngest, did well on risperidone therapy. CONCLUSION: We believe that risperidone is not a substitute for clozapine in treating psychosis in parkinsonian patients and should be used with caution.","Aged, Antiparkinson Agents/*adverse effects, Clozapine/*therapeutic use, Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced/drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Male, Parkinson Disease/complications/*drug therapy/etiology/psychology, Parkinson Disease, Secondary/chemically induced/drug therapy, Psychoses, Substance-Induced/*drug therapy/etiology, Risperidone/*adverse effects/therapeutic use",-1

To compare this functional evaluation with spasticity scores in different muscle groups. METHODS: In 11 patients with spasticity of cerebral origin (mainly cerebral palsy), double-blind scoring of spasticity (Ashworth scale score and visual analog score), spasms, pain, and functional abilities was performed during tests with bolus injections including a placebo control. Eight patients were considered good responders and received a subcutaneous device for intrathecal drug delivery. Six of these patients were followed up for 2 years, during which they underwent the same scoring procedures as after their bolus injections. These patients were subjected to a blinded dose reduction test. RESULTS: There was a noticeable placebo effect on spasticity scores during tests with bolus injections. Eight patients demonstrated a significant beneficial effect of intrathecal bolus injections compared with this placebo effect. Functional improvements were noted in most patients. During continuous infusion, Ashworth scale scores were less favorable but still significantly lower than at baseline. Subjective evaluation (visual analog scores) remained positive, functional improvements were maintained, and patient comfort was invariably and significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal administration of baclofen is a safe and effective treatment for spasticity of cerebral origin. Functional improvement was demonstrated. The presence of a placebo effect on the spasticity scores suggests the need for double-blind screening in each patient.","Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/*complications, Child, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Pain Measurement, Placebos, Prospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1
12763471,Seizures and therapy in adolescents with uncomplicated epilepsy.,"Raty LK, Wilde-Larsson B, Soderfeldt BA",Seizure. 2003 Jun;12(4):229-36.,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe seizures and their therapy among Swedish adolescents, aged 13-22, with active but uncomplicated epilepsy. METHOD: The adolescents answered questionnaires (158/193). Data were also obtained from medical records. RESULTS: Epileptic seizure types could be specified in 92.1% of the cases. Predominant types were Primary Generalised Tonic-Clonic Seizures and Partial Complex Seizures with Secondary Generalisation. Clinical diagnoses by physicians were unspecified in 25.8%. Ninety percent were on antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), most commonly valproate and carbamazepine. New AEDs were used in 9.3% of the cases and polytherapy in 13.9%. More than 40% of the respondents had seizures despite AED treatment. Side effects of AEDs were experienced by 61%, most commonly tiredness, concentration difficulties and headache. Patients on polytherapy experienced significantly more side effects. The choice of a new AED over a traditional one was not related to seizure type or seizure control. CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents had persistent seizures despite treatment at a specialist regional epilepsy centre. This, plus the high reported rate of side effects of AED treatment, suggests that treatment is not optimal for the group studied. As traditional AEDs strongly dominated treatment possibly newly marketed AEDs are underused in this group.","Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Delivery of Health Care/standards, Disease Progression, Epilepsy/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Medical Records, Questionnaires, Seizures/*drug therapy, Sex Factors, Treatment Outcome",-1

Two hundred and thirty-five surveys were distributed. Mean age of the child was 8 years 6 months (SD 4y : 9mo) and 56% of the sample was male with 35% full-time independent ambulators, while the rest used an assistive device or a wheelchair. Fifty-four percent were in special education classrooms. Families were given a survey on functional status of the child with CP, CAM usage of the child and the parent, factors influencing the decision to use CAM, demographics, and clinical information. Of the families, 56%, used one or more CAM techniques. Massage therapy (25%) and aquatherapy (25%) were the most common. Children of families that used CAM were significantly younger (7y : 9mo, SD 4y : 7mo) than non-users (9y : 6mo, SD 4y : 6mo: t-test p < 0.01 two-tailed). Children with quadriplegic CP, with spasticity, and those who could not walk independently were more commonly exposed to CAM (Pearson's chi2 [P(chi)2] p = 0.01 two-tailed; for mobility, odds ratio [OR] of 2.5 with regression). Mothers with a college degree had a greater tendency to use CAM for their child than those without (P(chi)2 p = 0.01 two-tailed). Fathers of children who used CAM were older than fathers of those who did not (37y : 9mo versus 33y : 2mo, p = 0.04 two-tailed). There was no significant difference between groups for mother's age, father's education, income, or for population of home town. Parents who used CAM for themselves were more likely to try CAM for their child (70% versus 47%, OR 2.1), and were much more likely to be pleased with the outcome (71% versus 42%, OR 3.5). Child's age (younger), lack of independent mobility, and parental use of CAM were the most significant predictive factors identified via logistic regression.","Adolescent, Cerebral Palsy/*therapy, Child, Child, Preschool, Complementary Therapies/*statistics & numerical data, Female, Health Care Surveys/statistics & numerical data, Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice, Humans, Infant, Male, Severity of Illness Index, Socioeconomic Factors",-1

The efficacy of GVG and LTG in combination was evaluated in a prospective audit of 42 patients with intractable epilepsy. There was a statistically significant median reduction of 62% (P < 0.025) from a median baseline monthly seizure frequency (MSF) of 29 (mean 59, 95% CI 22, 96) to a median MSF of 11 (mean 23, 95% CI 8, 38) during a median treatment period of eight months, with a greater than 50% reduction in MSF in 29 patients (69%) treated with the add-on combination of GVG and LTG. The additional MSF reduction achieved by the combination amounted to 21% (18% when GVG was added to LTG and 24% when LTG was added to GVG). The median trough plasma lamotrigine concentration was 9.9 mg/l (range 3.4-19.6 mg/l). The average daily dose of LTG was 517 mg (range, 175-800 mg) and GVG 2400 mg (range, 1500-3500 mg). Adverse events requiring alteration of therapy occurred in 24 patients (57%) with a drop-out rate of 12%. The combination of GVG and LTG should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with intractable epilepsy. The results of the present study support the need to confirm additive efficacy of GVG and LTG by conducting controlled trials of this combination therapy.","Adolescent, Adult, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Drug Combinations, Epilepsy, Complex Partial/*drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Triazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Vigabatrin, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use",-1

A national survey in the USA in 1979 indicated that 35% of American adults experience insomnia in the course of a year. The prevalence of EDS varies depending on the survey (0.3 to 13.3%), but a recent study stated that 2.4% of individuals reported that they continually fell asleep at work. These problems are often long term and negatively affect the individuals' quality of life. People with these sleep problems often have difficulties maintaining high levels of productivity at work or pursuing their daily activities; individuals with insomnia lack the feeling of being rested or refreshed in the morning and EDS is unavoidable in most cases. Behavioural therapy has been shown to be effective for many people affected with insomnia and EDS. However, pharmacological treatments using hypnosedatives and central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are usually necessary, and effective, for those with more severe cases. These compounds have thus been widely prescribed in clinical practice (e.g., 2.6% of all adults surveyed used medically prescribed hypnosedatives and 4.5% used over-the-counter drugs to promote sleep). The onset and duration of action of these hypnosedatives and CNS stimulant drugs are important factors to be considered when prescribing these compounds. These factors primarily depend on physicochemical properties (lipid solubility and protein binding), as well as the pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, distribution, elimination and clearance) of the compounds. Significant differences in profile exist amongst hypnosedatives and CNS stimulants, and these differences may account for the observed variations in clinical action and adverse effects during and after treatment. In this review, we will introduce recently obtained knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of hypnosedatives and CNS stimulants and their applications for patients affected with insomnia and EDS.","Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Narcolepsy/*drug therapy/*metabolism, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*drug therapy/*metabolism",-1

Lidocaine is used as internal standard. RSDs (%) of the within-day and between-day precision studies are always less than 7.2 on the entire range of calibration. Linearity is inspected using an analysis of variance ANOVA. Homogeneity of the variances is tested using Hartley's test. Weighted linear regression is then computed. Limits of detection and quantification are given by an analysis of the blanks. The present method was applied in our laboratory over a period of 1 year. Meprobamate appeared as a drug which still has a significant frequency (5.5%) and is the most frequently involved in fatal pharmaceutical overdoses (15.3%).

Comparison of randomized and non-randomized inpatient and outpatient samples at baseline and in treatment outcomes up to one year was made to determine whether the findings of the RCT generalized to non-randomized patients in the same treatment program. One hundred and twenty one patients with intractable pain, randomized between inpatient, outpatient and waiting list control, were compared with 128 who elected for either inpatient or outpatient treatment. Treatment was a group-based multidisciplinary cognitive-behavioral treatment program aimed at enabling patients to return to more normal function despite persistent pain, delivered to mixed groups of randomized and elective patients, and outcome was measured by physical performance, pain impact on function, mood, and drug use. Agreement to randomization was a function of travelling distance from home to hospital. Non-randomized patients largely resembled their randomized counterparts before and after treatment. In order to indicate the clinical significance of results, analyses were conducted using numbers needed to treat (NNTs). NNTs estimate the number of patients required in the treatment condition for one of them to achieve the specified outcome who would not have achieved it in the comparison condition. Across a range of measures at one month follow-up, comparison of inpatients with outpatients gave NNTs between 2.3 and 7.5, and comparison of inpatients with waiting list controls gave NNTs between 2.3 and 3.6. At one year inpatients showed greater likelihood than outpatients of maintaining these treatment gains.","Adult, Chronic Disease, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, Female, Humans, Inpatients, Male, Middle Aged, Outpatients, *Pain Management, *Patient Satisfaction, *Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1
12919436,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura after cephalosporin administration: a possible relationship.,"Baron BW, van Besien K, Hoffman PC, Kohn OF, Rossof AH, Baron JM",Transfusion. 2003 Sep;43(9):1317-21.,"BACKGROUND: Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an autoimmune disorder. The pathogenesis is believed to be mediated by an autoantibody directed against the metalloproteinase responsible for the degradation of the very-high-molecular-weight multimers of the vWF. The syndrome can be precipitated by a variety of conditions, and certain medications also have been implicated. CASE REPORTS: The cases of two patients who took a cephalosporin antibiotic, cephalexin (Keflex, Eli Lilly), and then developed TTP are reported. One patient subsequently received a third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone (Rocephin, Roche), without adverse reaction. Of interest, one patient had taken cefaclor (Ceclor, Eli Lilly) 8 years before and had also developed TTP at that time. The other patient also took cefaclor for approximately 3 weeks before taking cephalexin. In addition, she had had a dose of clarithromycin (Biaxin, Abbott Laboratories) the day before the onset of the TTP symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, TTP has not been reported previously after administration of cephalosporin antibiotics. Attention is called to the possibility that this syndrome may occur after exposure to some of these drugs, although the incidence is very rare or, alternatively, underdiagnosed.","Adult, Anti-Bacterial Agents/*adverse effects/chemistry, Cephalexin/*adverse effects/chemistry, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/*chemically induced",-1

In all, 261 CPS were collected from their video-EEG (VEEG) recordings. Cerebral speech dominance was determined by intracarotid injection of sodium amobarbital (Wada test) in all cases. Ictal speech manifestations, classified as verbalization or vocalization, occurred in 32 patients (47.1%) with 96 seizures (36.8%). Ictal verbalization occurred in 10 patients (14.7%). Ictal vocalization was observed in 28 patients (41.2%); including 6 patients who also had ictal verbalization. Thirty-six patients (52.9%) had no seizure with ictal speech manifestations. Ictal verbalization had significant lateralization value: 90% of patients with this manifestation had seizure focus in the nondominant temporal lobe (p = 0.049). Seizures of patients with ictal vocalization were not more likely to arise from either temporal lobe. We also observed bilingual patients who exclusively spoke in their mother tongue (Taiwanese) rather than the acquired language (Mandarin) in 72.2% of seizures with verbalization. This finding is significant and contrary to a commonly held notion that the acquired language is used in seizures associated with speech behaviors.","Adolescent, Adult, Amobarbital/diagnostic use/pharmacology, *Electroencephalography, Epilepsy, Complex Partial/diagnosis/physiopathology, Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe/*diagnosis/physiopathology, Female, Functional Laterality/drug effects/physiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Speech/drug effects/*physiology, Temporal Lobe/drug effects/*physiology, Video Recording",-1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this double blind trial 60 children scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to two groups to receive 0.25 mg.kg or 5 mg.kg nasal ketamine. We measured level of acceptance of medication, sedation, hemodynamic variables, reaction to separation from parents, side effects and time until recovery from anesthesia. RESULTS: The two groups were homogeneous. Acceptance of medication was good or adequate in all patients. The level of sedation was significant in both groups 10 min after premedication. Systolic arterial pressure was higher in the ketamine group 20 min after administration of the drug and upon arrival in the operating theater. Reaction to separation from parents was good in all groups. Secretions were higher in the ketamine group and hallucinations were experienced by three patients in the ketamine group and by two in the midazolam group. We found no difference in time until spontaneous eye opening after surgery. No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The nasal route is adequately accepted by children. Both drugs are effective by this route and sedation is rapid. Time until postanesthetic recovery is similar with both drugs.

Forty-seven percent of the study population were considered to be of subnormal intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: In a children's hospital outpatient population in the Western Cape region of South Africa, the prevalence of secondary epilepsy is higher than is found in developed countries.

Gabapentin, a synthetic structural analogue of GABA, has been shown to have beneficial effects in the treatment of neuropathic pain in other diagnostic groups; however, no standardized clinical trial has been performed to evaluate its efficacy after SCI. DESIGN: A 10-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of SCI-related neuropathic pain. METHODS: Seven subjects with neuropathic pain, who were more than 30 days post-SCI, completed the study. Two groups received a 4-week course of gabapentin and placebo in a randomized crossover design with a 2-week washout period. The Neuropathic Pain Scale was used to record daily pain levels. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS: Gabapentin has some beneficial effects on certain types of neuropathic pain. There was a significant decrease of ""unpleasant feeling"" and a trend toward a decrease in both the ""pain intensity"" and ""burning sensation"" at the fourth week of gabapentin treatment compared with those on the placebo. No significant difference was found among other pain descriptors during the gabapentin and placebo treatment, although this may have been limited by the small sample size and low maximum dosage of gabapentin. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin reduces certain types of neuropathic pain in the SCI population. Future studies with larger sample sizes, higher dosages, and quicker titration will help further determine the efficacy of gabapentin in the treatment of SCI-related neuropathic pain.","Acetates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Analgesics/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Cross-Over Studies, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuralgia/*drug therapy/*etiology, Pain Measurement, Prospective Studies, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications/rehabilitation, Time Factors, Trauma Severity Indices, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Current treatment options available in the physical management of children in a low-level state and factors influencing the physiotherapy treatment of children in a low-level state will be discussed. The complex neuropathology of VS and MCS helps to explain the varied clinical presentations of children in VS and MCS. Spasticity and muscle contracture are common motor sequelae of VS and MCS. Loss of inhibition by descending motor pathways is thought to result in increased muscle tone or spasticity. However, secondary changes in muscle fibre structure and periarticular connective tissue may be an additional component to increased muscle tone. A multimodal approach combining physical, pharmacological and surgical interventions is likely to be the most effective. Knowledge of the likelihood of recovery from VS and MCS can be helpful in determining the frequency and intensity of physiotherapy. Ethical issues in the management of children in a low-level state include a consideration of the benefits to the child and the child's family and the costs to the health care team and the medical institution.","Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Contracture/etiology/*therapy, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/etiology/*therapy, Persistent Vegetative State/complications/physiopathology/*therapy, Physical Therapy Specialty/*methods, Range of Motion, Articular, Thalamus/physiopathology",-1

Patients under anti-epileptic drug monotherapy during 8 weeks baseline (BSL) with 6 or more seizures were treated with GBP for 26 weeks up to 2400 mg/day. Patients obtaining complete seizure control of all seizures or any partial seizure type during the last 8 weeks were calculated. Seizure frequency was compared between BSL and last 8 weeks.

The purpose of this paper is to present a review of our institution's first three years' experience with postoperative pain and spasticity management in patients who have undergone SDR. The medical records of the 55 patients who had an SDR during the study period were reviewed. The basis of postoperative analgesia was morphine, with the majority of patients receiving continuous morphine infusions (20-40 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 49), 60 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 1)). Four patients used a patient-controlled delivery system. One patient had successful analgesia with epidural morphine. Ketorolac (1 mg.kg-1 i.v. loading dose followed by 0.5 mg.kg-1 i.v. every six hr for 48 hr) was used as an adjunct to morphine in six patients. For management of postoperative muscle spasm, an intravenous benzodiazepine was used (diazepam 0.1 mg.kg-1 (n = 2), or midazolam infusion 10-30 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 (n = 51)). All patients were cared for on a ward where nurses were familiar with the use of continuous opioid and benzodiazepine infusions. All patients received continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring as well as frequent nursing assessment. There were no episodes of postoperative apnoea or excessive sedation. We have found the use of continuous infusions of morphine and midazolam, along with adjunct ketorolac, to be effective in treating postoperative pain and muscle spasms following SDR.","Adolescent, Adult, *Analgesia, Analgesia, Epidural, Analgesia, Patient-Controlled, Analgesics/administration & dosage, Bupivacaine/administration & dosage, Cerebral Palsy/*surgery, Child, Child, Preschool, Diazepam/administration & dosage, Female, Humans, Ketorolac, Male, Midazolam/administration & dosage, Morphine/administration & dosage, Muscle Spasticity/*surgery, Nausea/chemically induced, Pain, Postoperative/*prevention & control, Postoperative Complications/prevention & control, Spasm/prevention & control, Spinal Nerve Roots/*surgery, Tolmetin/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives, Vomiting/chemically induced",-1

The clinical syndrome includes muscle rigidity, hypercapnia, tachycardia and myoglobinuria as result of increased carbon dioxide production, oxygen consumption and muscle membrane breakdown. In human beings and animals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, it is generally accepted that an increase in the level of myoplasmic free calcium is the cause of the syndrome. Various hypotheses have been proposed to account for the increase of intracellular calcium levels, e.g. a defect in the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (ryanodine receptor), an abnormality of the excitation-contraction coupling mechanisms, or alterations in second messenger systems of skeletal muscles. This review gives an overview of the main features of this disease and recent advances in research including pathophysiology, treatment, diagnosis and genetics as well as association with other disorders.","Anesthesia, Animals, Humans, Malignant Hyperthermia/*etiology/therapy, Muscular Diseases/etiology, Second Messenger Systems/physiology, Serotonin/physiology, Stress, Psychological/complications, Temperature",-1

It was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery. METHODS. Patients were randomly allocated to eight groups, each receiving a different opioid within a clinical, equipotent dose range (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, pethidine, tramadol, alfentanil). A complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5, 10, 15, and 20 min following opioid administration. Monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status. Statistical evaluation was performed by 1- and 2-factorial ANOVA (P < 0.05). RESULTS. Significant time effects (changes from baseline at the time of measurement) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance, while significant group (group-specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, stroke volume index, and PaO2. No major effects were observed following morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, tramadol, and nalbuphine. Buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone. Pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in MPAP and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression. CONCLUSIONS. For interpretation of the results, factors such as respiratory depression, histamine release, secretion of endogenous catecholamines, and hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed. Tramadol, an opioid with moderate potency, seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects.","Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/*pharmacology, Blood Gas Analysis, Female, Hemodynamics/*drug effects, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pulmonary Circulation/drug effects, Regional Blood Flow/drug effects, Respiratory Function Tests, Risk Factors, Vascular Surgical Procedures",-1

The experience with six patients, aged 17-73 years, treated with clonidine for spasticity due to brain injuries of various causes is presented. These cases include a patient with traumatic brain injury, three patients with intracranial haemorrhage, a patient with a right basal ganglia stroke 3 years prior to a left subdural haematoma associated with a fall, and a patient with cerebral palsy. To varying degrees for each patient, clonidine was effective in reducing extremity hypertonicity. A possible mechanism of action is discussed. These case findings suggest clonidine may be useful in the management of spasticity associated with various forms of brain injury, and that formal studies of clonidine for this application appear warranted.","Adolescent, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Brain Injuries/complications/*drug therapy, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology",-1

Patients also received tests of hearing, verbal comprehension and naming, a short cognitive battery, and the Beck Depression Inventory. Patients with MS were impaired in identifying emotional states from prosodic cues. The magnitude of the deficits was greatest for patients with severe physical disability and under test conditions of limited prosodic information. Correlational analyses suggested that the patients' difficulties in comprehending affective prosodic information were not secondary to hearing loss, aphasic deficits, cognitive impairment, or depression.

Opioid administered by continuous intravenous infusion gave excellent relief from headache, muscle pain and pain from renal calculi. He continued to complain of burning pain in response to tactile stimuli. A prior quantitative sensory test had shown changes in sensation. Intravenous adenosine (ADO) infusions were given weekly. After 5 weeks of infusions, there was no recurrence of pain between treatments. ADO infusions were continued for 7 months without any side effects or signs of tolerance to the drug. There are indications that ADO may play a role as a modulator of neuropathic and nociceptive pain. In this case with pronounced allodynia, our interpretation is that neuropathic mechanisms were responsible and that ADO infusions played an important role in controlling pain.","Adenosine/*administration & dosage, Adolescent, Analgesics/*administration & dosage, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous/methods, Male, Metabolic Diseases/complications/drug therapy, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology",-1

The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the management of opioid side effects in the context of cancer pain management or, in the event that no evidence was available for cancer pain, for chronic noncancer pain. The side effects studied were constipation, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, myoclonus, sedation, respiratory depression, and delirium. Opioid rotation to manage side effects was also studied. For each side effect, we searched MEDLINE and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and identified 657 possible titles for inclusion. Of these, 67 studies met inclusion criteria for analysis. The lack of well-designed, randomized controlled trials and the heterogeneity of populations and study designs made the drawing of firm conclusions difficult and precluded performance of meta-analysis. The type, strength, and consistency of evidence for available interventions to manage opioid side effects vary from strong (eg, on the use of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression or constipation) to weak (eg, changing from the oral to epidural route of morphine administration to manage sedation).

METHODS: Conducted in an outpatient setting and reflecting usual practice, this study compared tolerability of GBP dosages < or = 1,800 versus >1,800 mg/day, when these doses were required to achieve the most effective seizure control. Two analyses of adverse events are presented: tolerability and safety. In the tolerability analysis, each patient served as his or her own control to compare the occurrence of adverse events at GBP < or =1,800 versus >1,800 mg/day. The safety analysis required patients to receive at least one dose of GBP and have a follow-up contact. RESULTS: A total of 2,216 patients enrolled in this open-label, 16-week study and were evaluable for safety. Of these, 74.0% completed the 16-week study, and 281 met the tolerability criteria. Within these 281 patients, two mutually exclusive groups were compared (a) those reporting adverse events at only < or =1,800 mg/day (low dose); and (b) those reporting adverse events at only >1,800 mg/day (high dose). Three adverse events (asthenia, headache, and dizziness) were observed in a statistically significantly larger number of patients at only the low dose than in the group reporting these same adverse events at only the high dose, suggesting that patients who tolerated GBP at < or = 1,800 mg/day did not experience a significant increase in adverse events with dosages >1,800 mg/day. Overall, 10.6% of the 2,216 patients in the safety population prematurely withdrew because of adverse events, and 3.5% discontinued because of lack of efficacy. Safety and tolerability of GBP was rated as excellent or good for 78.5% of all patients.

DESIGN: An overview of pain pathways is presented, beginning in the periphery and progressing centrally, and the ascending and descending pathways are described in detail. RESULTS: The nociceptive pathway, consisting of the classic three-neuron chain, is now understood to be a dual system at each level, and the sensation of pain is thought to arrive in the central nervous system with the discriminative component of pain (""first pain"") carried separately from the affective-motivational component of pain (""second pain""). In addition to spinal control mechanisms of nociceptive transmission, descending pathways that originate in three major areas--the cortex, thalamus, and brain stem--can modify functions at the spinal level. At every level of the nervous system, a close relationship prevails between somatic pain pathways and visceral pathways. This relationship likely accounts for the transmission of visceral pain and also for autonomic responses to somatic pain and somatic responses to visceral pain. CONCLUSION: By understanding the pathways of pain and the transmitters involved, prevention and treatment of pain will be improved.","Afferent Pathways/physiology, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology, Cerebral Cortex/physiology, Efferent Pathways/physiology, Humans, Nerve Fibers/physiology, Nociceptors/physiology, Pain/*physiopathology, Spinal Nerves/physiology, Thalamic Nuclei/physiology",-1

Patients who abuse prescription drugs may exhibit certain patterns, such as escalating use, drug-seeking behavior and doctor shopping. A basic clinical survival skill in situations in which patients exert pressure on the physician to obtain a prescription drug is to say ""no"" and stick with it.

Increasingly, studies are focusing on the large number of elderly with important pain problems in long-term care. The inclusion of pain as an area of clinical focus in the Minimum Data Set has fueled interest in this problem and will provide solid data for future study. Researchers are attempting to establish reliable and valid data using standardized assessment tools previously validated in younger adults and are attempting use of traditional and cutting-edge assessment tools in cognitively impaired patients. Assessment is being linked to innovative interventions in noncommunicative, cognitively impaired residents using primary care nurses who best know these patients to decipher ""normal"" from ""abnormal"" behavior. The application of available pharmacologic interventions are more challenging because of the higher incidence of side effects in the elderly; part of this problem is the result of the decreased hepatic metabolism and renal clearance present in older patients. The nursing home environment has limited resources that can create logistical concerns in terms of diagnosis and treatment but also can positively limit overly invasive modalities.

Epub 2002 Apr 16.,"Facilitated glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1) deficiency syndrome (MIM 138140) defines a prototype of a novel group of disorders resulting from impaired glucose transport across blood-tissue barriers. It is caused by a defect in glucose transport into brain, mediated by the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT1. Since 1991, more than 70 patients have been identified. The hallmark of the disease is a low glucose concentration in the CSF (hypoglycorrhachia) in the presence of normoglycaemia (CSF/blood glucose ratio <0.4). Clinical features are variable and include seizures, developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, hypotonia, and a complex motor disorder with elements of ataxia, dystonia, and spasticity. The GLUT1 defect can be confirmed in erythrocytes by glucose uptake studies and GLUT1 immunoreactivity, and by molecular analysis of the GLUT1 gene. Several heterozygous mutations resulting in GLUT1 haploinsufficiency have been identified. An effective treatment is available by means of a ketogenic diet as ketone bodies serve as an alternative fuel for the developing brain.

Involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is rare and due to the fact that both clinical alertness and establishment of the diagnosis are delayed, the disease progresses causing serious problems. We report here a case of neuroparacoccidioidomycosis (NPCM), observed in a 55 year-old male, who consulted due to neurological symptoms (left hemiparesis, paresthesias, right palpebral ptosis, headache, vomiting and tonic clonic seizures) of a month duration. Upon physical examination, an ulcerated granulomatous lesion was observed in the abdomen. To confirm the diagnosis a stereotactic biopsy was taken; additionally, mycological tests from the ulcerated lesion and a bronchoalveolar lavage were performed. In the latter specimens, P. brasiliensis yeast cells were visualized and later on, the brain biopsy revealed the presence of the fungus. Treatment with itraconazole (ITZ) was initiated but clinical improvement was unremarkable; due to the fact that the patient was taking sodium valproate for seizure control, drug interactions were suspected and confirmed by absence of ITZ plasma levels. The latter medication was changed to clonazepam and after several weeks, clinical improvement began to be noticed and was accompanied by diminishing P. brasiliensis antigen and antibody titers. In the PCM endemic areas, CNS involvement should be considered more often and the efficacy of itraconazole therapy should also be taken into consideration.","Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antifungal Agents/blood/*therapeutic use, Brain Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Clonazepam/therapeutic use, Drug Interactions, Humans, Itraconazole/blood/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Paracoccidioidomycosis/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Seizures/drug therapy, Treatment Outcome, Valproic Acid/therapeutic use",-1

Treatment regimens including glucose and electrolyte infusions during acute illnesses, oral carnitine supplementation and/or a low-protein or lysine-restricted diet have been recommended, but their efficacy has been documented only on an anecdotal basis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 57 patients with proven GDD-relating appearance and severity of neurological disease to age and clinical status at diagnosis, glutaric acid levels in body fluids, and different treatment regimens. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were diagnosed after the onset of neurological disease (symptomatic group), twenty-one before (presymptomatic group). Carnitine levels were found to be reduced in all patients at diagnosis. In the symptomatic group, macrocephaly had been present around birth and was followed by rapid postnatal head growth in 70% of the children. The patients often showed symptoms such as hypotonia, irritability, and jitteriness followed by an acute encephalopathic crisis occurring on average at 12 months of age. Common neuroimaging findings included frontotemporal atrophy, subependymal pseudocysts, delayed myelination, basal ganglia atrophy, chronic subdural effusions and hematomas. In four patients the latter two findings were initially misinterpreted as resulting from child abuse. Other important misdiagnoses in older siblings who were affected and went undiagnosed include postencephalitic cerebral palsy, dystonic cerebral palsy and sudden infant death syndrome. Metabolic treatment did not convincingly improve the neurological disease, although it may have prevented further deterioration. Symptomatic treatment with baclofen or benzodiazepines was effective in reducing muscle spasms. Children in the presymptomatic group were diagnosed because of familiarity for the disease (n = 13), macrocephaly and/or additional minor neurological signs in infancy (n = 6), or acute encephalopathy, which was fully reversible after prompt treatment (n = 2). After diagnosis, all children were treated with oral carnitine, fluid infusion during intercurrent illnesses and, in addition, a diet was started in 13 of the 21 children. All 21 children except one (born prematurely at 31 weeks) have continued to develop normally up to now. Mean age at report is 6.3 years with a range from 6 months to 14.8 years. In older patients, the neuroradiological changes, present in infancy as in the symptomatic patients, became less prominent and in one girl disappeared. CONCLUSIONS: In presymptomatic children with GDD, the onset of neurological disease can be prevented by vigorous treatment of catabolic crises during illnesses together with carnitine supplementation. The importance of dietary therapy remains unclear and needs further evaluation. The potential treatability of GDD calls for increased attention to early presenting signs in order to recognize the disorder and to initiate treatment before the onset of irreversible neurological disease.","Adolescent, Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology/*genetics/therapy, Atrophy, Brain/pathology, Brain Diseases, Metabolic/enzymology/*genetics/therapy, Carnitine/administration & dosage, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Diet, Protein-Restricted, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Glutaryl-CoA Dehydrogenase, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Neurologic Examination, Oxidoreductases/*deficiency/genetics, *Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors, Tomography, X-Ray Computed",-1
11145638,New avenues in treatment of paediatric migraine: a review of the literature.,Pakalnis A,Fam Pract. 2001 Feb;18(1):101-6.,"BACKGROUND: Headaches are a common problem in paediatric practice. Recurrent headaches can be a significant source of stress for patient and parents, and disruptive regarding school obligations and parental work responsibilities. Most treatment interventions are developed from research data extrapolated from adult studies, with resultant concerns of safety and efficacy when utilizing these therapeutic conclusions in children. METHODS: This paper incorporates current treatment strategies in paediatric migraine utilizing a Medline search of English language studies from January 1988 to December 1999, with a literature search referencing the terms of paediatrics, migraines, headaches, therapy and treatment. Reference sections of the articles were reviewed for pertinent information prior to January 1988. Articles were evaluated systematically to formulate concise terms for diagnosis of paediatric migraine and applicability to clinical treatment studies. Particular emphasis was placed on newer options with relevance in adult treatment such as triptans and anti-epileptic drugs, and their benefit in therapy of paediatric migraine. Non-pharmacological options were also subjected to organized review to determine relevance in treatment of paediatric migraine. RESULTS: The review of the literature indicates that although migraine in childhood and adolescence appears to be increasing in prevalence, few clinical studies are available, with most current treatment recommendations utilizing data from adult studies. CONCLUSION: Further headache treatment studies in the paediatric population are necessary in order to ascertain safety and efficacy of pharmaco-therapeutics in these children. Also, much current interest in treatment in adults with recurrent headaches involves non-pharmacological areas-dietary modification and stress management. Application of these avenues especially warrants further clarification with regard to relevance in paediatric migraine treatment.","Adolescent, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Child, Humans, Migraine Disorders/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy, *Pediatrics, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/therapeutic use",-1

Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents.,"Cushman WC, Reda DJ, Perry HM, Williams D, Abdellatif M, Materson BJ",Arch Intern Med. 2000 Mar 27;160(6):825-31.,"BACKGROUND: Stroke incidence and mortality rates are higher in the southeastern region of the United States, which is called the ""Stroke Belt."" We compared the response to antihypertensive medication use in patients from different US regions. METHODS: The short-term and 1-year efficacy of the antihypertensive medications hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, diltiazem hydrochloride (sustained release), captopril, prazosin hydrochloride, and clonidine was compared by US region in a randomized controlled trial of 1,105 men with hypertension from 15 US Veterans Affairs medical centers. RESULTS: Compared with patients outside the Stroke Belt, patients inside the Stroke Belt achieved significantly lower treatment success rates of diastolic blood pressure control at 1 year with hydrochlorothiazide (63% vs 41%), atenolol (62% vs 46%), captopril (60% vs 30%), and clonidine (69% vs 43%); there were no differences in treatment success rates with diltiazem (70% vs 71%) or prazosin (54% vs 53%). When controlling for race, patients inside the Stroke Belt had significantly lower treatment success rates with hydrochlorothiazide (P = .003) and clonidine (P = .003), and the lower success rate with atenolol approached significance (P = .15). Regardless of region, blacks were less likely than whites to achieve treatment success with atenolol (P = .02) or prazosin (P = .03) and more likely with diltiazem (P = .05). There was a trend for blacks residing inside the Stroke Belt to have a lower treatment success rate than other race-region groups when treated with captopril (P = .07). Many regional and racial differences in diet, lifestyle, and other characteristics were observed. After adjustment for these characteristics by regression analysis, the effect of residing inside the Stroke Belt remained for captopril (P = .01) and clonidine (P = .01) and approached significance for hydrochlorothiazide (P = .10). CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension in patients residing inside the Stroke Belt responded less to the use of several antihypertensive medications and important differences were shown in a number of characteristics that may affect the control of blood pressure, compared with patients residing outside the Stroke Belt.","Adult, African Americans/*statistics & numerical data, African Continental Ancestry Group, Aged, Antihypertensive Agents/*therapeutic use, Blood Pressure/drug effects, European Continental Ancestry Group/*statistics & numerical data, Hospitals, Veterans, Humans, Hypertension/complications/*drug therapy/*ethnology/etiology, Male, Middle Aged, Risk Factors, Southeastern United States/epidemiology, Treatment Outcome, United States/epidemiology",-1
7727052,The new anticonvulsant drugs. Implications for avoidance of adverse effects.,"Schmidt D, Kramer G",Drug Saf. 1994 Dec;11(6):422-31.,"Several new antiepileptic drugs offer a worthwhile alternative when standard antiepileptic drugs have failed. Suggestions have been made to improve the risk-benefit ratio of the new antiepileptic agents. More specifically, vigabatrin, which is a very useful and well tolerated new antiepileptic drug for refractory partial epilepsy, should be started at a low dosage of 0.5 g/day with increments of 0.5 g/day every week. Daily dosages exceeding 3 g/day should be restricted to patients with improvement. If necessary, the daily dosage of vigabatrin should be withdrawn slowly, i.e. by not more than 1 g/week. Lamotrigine is also a beneficial new drug for refractory partial and generalized seizures. However, the drug is associated with rash. In patients also receiving valproic acid (sodium valproate) [which inhibits the metabolism of lamotrigine], the incidence of rash can be reduced by slow titration of 25mg every other day for the first week and 25mg per day for the second week. Rare hypersensitivity reactions, e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, remain a problem. The risk-benefit ratio of felbamate has recently been compromised by fatal aplastic anaemia and fatal liver disease in a number of patients. In general, patients should be withdrawn from felbamate, if possible, until further clarification of its definitive risk-benefit ratio. Finally, gabapentin is a very safe add-on medication. Its remarkably low potential to cause adverse effects makes it a welcome addition for the treatment of refractory partial epilepsy.","Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/prevention & control, Anemia, Aplastic/chemically induced/prevention & control, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Drug Hypersensitivity/prevention & control, Drug-Induced Liver Injury, Epilepsy/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Liver Diseases/prevention & control, Mental Disorders/chemically induced/prevention & control, Phenylcarbamates, Propylene Glycols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Risk Assessment, Triazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Vigabatrin, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs &, derivatives/therapeutic use",-1

METHODS: Retrospective case review of all children admitted to two East London hospitals with malaria identified between 1996 and 2001 with the use of notifications and hospital discharge data. RESULTS: A total of 211 children with a median age of 9 years (range, 11 to 179 months) were identified. Children living in the UK who acquired malaria while visiting a malaria-endemic country on holiday accounted for 82% of cases, whereas the rest were children visiting the UK from endemic areas. Three-fourths of children who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area were born in the UK, and 93% were of Black African ethnicity. The peak seasonal incidence was late summer/early autumn. Plasmodium falciparum acquired in Africa accounted for 91% of cases. Although 42% of children took antimalarial prophylaxis, only 15% of medications were taken according to recommended guidelines. Another family member, most often a sibling, was found to have concurrent malaria in 23% (49 of 211) of cases. On the basis of the WHO criteria, 15 children (7.1%) 15 months to 15 years of age had severe malaria, including convulsions (n = 4), acute renal failure (n = 3), jaundice (n = 4), severe anemia (n = 3) and >2% parasitemia (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with malaria in this study were UK-born, school age, of Black African ethnicity and were visiting family in Africa, often with other family members. Most children had low level parasitemia and uncomplicated malaria, and they responded rapidly to antimalarial treatment.","Antimalarials/therapeutic use, Chi-Square Distribution, Child, Child, Preschool, Cohort Studies, Ethnic Groups/*statistics & numerical data, Female, Humans, Incidence, Infant, London/epidemiology, Malaria, Falciparum/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology, Male, Probability, Retrospective Studies, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, *Travel, Urban Population",-1

DESIGN: Retrospective review of patients charts who received gabapentin for at least 30 days. Data were collected concerning patients' diagnosis, current drug use, concurrent drug use, gabapentin dose, pain scores, and patient-reported side effects. Patients were divided into three groups based on their pain diagnosis; low back, neuropathic, and myofascial pain. The neuropathic group was subdivided into postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, sympathetically maintained pain, and phantom pain. SETTING: Two tertiary referral teaching hospitals in southeastern Michigan. RESULTS: A total of 122 charts were reviewed and included in this study. A significant decrease in pain scores with gabapentin was seen in the neuropathic pain group (paired t-test, p < .0001) but not in the low back pain group. Of the neuropathic pain group, patients with postherpetic neuralgia had the greatest decrease in pain scores. Ten patients showed a > 75% decrease in pain scores, of these: nine had a direct nerve injury, and one had postherpetic neuralgia. Opiate use was unchanged in all groups. Patients who were taking opiates had significantly less benefit with gabapentin use in terms of pain score. Patient-reported side effects were similar to those reported in a nonchronic pain population. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin may be a useful adjunct for treating neuropathic pain with a minimum of side effects. Particular advantage may be gained with the use of this drug for postherpetic neuralgia and direct peripheral nerve injuries.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Child, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Humans, Low Back Pain/drug therapy, Middle Aged, Myofascial Pain Syndromes/drug therapy, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/complications/*drug therapy, Retrospective Studies, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Its abuse appears to be increasing and as a result, so is its trafficking across borders, with ever-increasing sophistication of concealment (Rouse, 1992). Over the past few years, cases of cocaine intoxication have been reported, resulting from ruptured packets of cocaine that have been swallowed, or inserted into the vagina or rectum by couriers (drug smugglers), so called 'body packers' or 'mules' (Westli and Mittleman, 1981; Ricaurte and Langston, 1995). Cocaine is a powerful sympathomimetic and central nervous system stimulant, an overdose of which causes primarily cardiac, neurological and psychiatric effects (Ricaurte and Langston, 1995). Acute toxicity is dose-related and is characterized in the first place by its sympathomimetic effects, which include tachycardia, hypertension and hyperthermia arrythmias, followed by seizures. Brainstem depression and cardio-respiratory collapse, stroke, coma, intracranial vasculitis, myocardial infarction and sudden death have all been reported in cocaine abuse (Ricaurte and Langston, 1995).

11090860,Novel drug development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Hurko O, Walsh FS",J Neurol Sci. 2000 Nov 1;180(1-2):21-8.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has become an increasingly attractive area for the pharmaceutical industry, the most experimentally tractable of the neurodegenerative diseases. Mechanisms underlying cell death in ALS are likely to be important in more common but more complex disorders. Riluzole, the only drug launched for treatment ALS is currently undergoing industrial trials for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington disease, stroke and head injury. Other compounds in Phase III testing for ALS (mecamserin, xaliproden, gabapentin) are also in trials for other neurodegenerative disorders. Mechanisms of action of these advanced compounds are limited to glutamate antagonism, direct or indirect growth factor activity, as well as GABA agonism and interaction with calcium channels. A broader range of mechanisms is represented by compounds in Phase I trials: glutamate antagonism (dextramethorphan/p450 inhibitor; talampanel), growth factors (leukemia inhibiting factor; IL-1 receptor; encapsulated cells secreting CNTF) and antioxidants (TR500, a glutathione-repleting agent; recombinant superoxide dismutase; procysteine.) An even broader range of mechanisms is being explored in preclinical discovery programs. Recognition of the difficulties associated with delivery of protein therapeutics to the CNS has led to development of small molecules interacting either with neurotrophin receptors or with downstream intracellular signalling pathways. Other novel drug targets include caspaces, protein kinases and other molecules influencing apoptosis. High-throughput screens of large libraries of small molecules yield lead compounds that are subsequently optimized by chemists, screened for toxicity, and validated before a candidate is selected for clinical trials. The net is cast wide in early discovery efforts, only about 1% of which result in useful drugs at the end of a decade-long process. Successful discovery and development of novel drugs will increasingly depend on collaborative efforts between the academy and industry.","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/*drug therapy, Animals, *Drug Design, Humans",-1
9530793,Medication use for low back pain in primary care.,"Cherkin DC, Wheeler KJ, Barlow W, Deyo RA",Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 1998 Mar 1;23(5):607-14.,"STUDY DESIGN: A longitudinal observational study of primary care patients with low back pain. OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe medications prescribed for back pain, 2) to identify patient characteristics associated with type of drug therapy, 3) to determine if the prescription of certain drugs is associated with better outcomes, and 4) to compare physician prescribing behavior with national guidelines. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few previous studies have focused on medication prescribing patterns for back pain in primary care. METHODS: Two-hundred nineteen patients aged 20-69 years who were making a first visit for an episode of back pain were studied. After the visit, patients completed questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, health status, back pain experience, and use of medications. Symptom severity and dysfunction were assessed by telephone 1 week after the visit. RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent of patients were prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 35% muscle relaxants, 12% narcotics, and 4% acetaminophen. Twenty percent received no medications. Patients were more likely to receive medications if they had a desire for medication, pain below the knee, less than 3 weeks of pain before visit, more severe symptoms, or greater dysfunction. Patients with more severe symptoms were more likely to receive narcotics or muscle relaxants. Patients with greater dysfunction were also more likely to receive narcotics. Type of drug therapy predicted symptom severity but not dysfunction after 1 week. Controlling for other factors, those receiving medications had less severe symptoms after 1 week than patients who received no medication. Patients receiving both muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had the best outcomes. Medication use for back pain in this health maintenance organization was generally concordant with national guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, often augmented by muscle relaxants, are a standard medical treatment for back pain in primary care. In this observational study, patients prescribed medications, particularly muscle relaxants, reported less severe symptoms after 1 week than those receiving no medications. However, randomized trials are needed to determine which medication or combinations of medications are most effective.","Adult, Aged, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Drug Prescriptions, Female, Guideline Adherence, Health Maintenance Organizations, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Low Back Pain/*drug therapy, Male, Middle Aged, Physician's Practice Patterns, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Primary Health Care/*methods/standards, Treatment Outcome",-1

Between September 1991 and March 1995, intrathecal baclofen was infused in 18 selected patients out of a series of 42 severely disabled spastic cases. We report here our preliminary experience with the criteria of selection, the initial intrathecal bolus test and the long-term benefit of the selected patients. Our results confirm the dramatic immediate and long-term benefit reported in other series.

As such, the pathogenesis is considered to involve an interaction of augmented sensory processing (central sensitization) and peripheral pain generators. The notion, that FM symptomatology results from an amplification of incoming sensory impulses, has revolutionized the contemporary understanding of this enigmatic problem and provided a more rational approach to treatment. To date, the management of FM has been mainly palliative, with the aims of reducing pain, improving sleep, maintaining function, treating psychologic distress and diminishing the impact of associated syndromes. The rapidly evolving neurophysiologic, psychophysiologic and molecular biologic basis for chronic pain states has already opened up new avenues for management which should be applicable to this difficult group of patients.

12122916,The neuropharmacology of centrally-acting analgesic medications in fibromyalgia.,Rao SG,Rheum Dis Clin North Am. 2002 May;28(2):235-59.,"As demonstrated above, the anatomy and neuropharmacology of the pain pathways within the CNS, even to the level of the midbrain, are extraordinarily complex. Indeed, discussions of the effects of these agents on the neuropharmacology of the thalamus, hypothalamus, and cortex were excluded from this review owing to their adding further to this complexity. Also, the dearth of data regarding FMS pain pathophysiology necessitated a relatively generic analysis of the pain pathways. As mentioned in the introduction, the current thought is that central sensitization plays an important role in FMS. However, we see in this chapter that the behavioral state of central sensitization may be a result of alterations in either the ascending systems or in one or more descending systems. Studies to assess the presence or relative importance of such changes in FMS are difficult to perform in humans, and to date there are no animal models of FMS. Accepting these limitations, it is apparent that many drugs considered to date for the treatment of FMS do target a number of appropriate sites within both the ascending and descending pain pathways. The data regarding clinical efficacy on some good candidate agents, however, is extremely preliminary. For example, it is evident from the present analysis that SNRIs, alpha 2 agonists, and NK1 antagonists may be particularly well suited to FMS, although current data supporting their use is either anecdotal or from open-label trials [114,149]. Other sites within the pain pathways have not yet been targeted. Examples of these include the use of CCKB antagonists to block on-cell activation or of nitric oxide synthetase antagonists to block the downstream mediators of NMDA activation. Efficacy of such agents may give considerable insight into the pathophysiology of FMS. Finally, as indicated previously, FMS consists of more than just chronic pain, and the question of how sleep abnormalities, depression, fatigues, and so forth tie into disordered pain processing is being researched actively. Future research focusing on how the various manifestations of FMS relate to one another undoubtedly will lead to a more rational targeting of drugs in this complex disorder.","Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Fibromyalgia/*drug therapy, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use",-1

METHODS: Twelve items describing the impact of MS on walking (12-Item MS Walking Scale [MSWS-12]) were generated from 30 patient interviews, expert opinion, and literature review. Preliminary psychometric evaluation (data quality, scaling assumptions, acceptability, reliability, validity) was undertaken in the data generated by 602 people from the MS Society membership database. Further psychometric evaluation (including comprehensive validity assessment, responsiveness, and relative efficiency) was conducted in two hospital-based samples: people with primary progressive MS (PPMS; n = 78) and people with relapses admitted for IV steroid treatment (n = 54). RESULTS: In all samples, missing data were low (< or =3.8%), item test-retest reproducibility was high (> or =0.78), scaling assumptions were satisfied, and reliability was high (> or =0.94). Correlations between the MSWS-12 and other scales were consistent with a priori hypotheses. The MSWS-12 (relative efficiency = 1.0) was more responsive than the Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis mobility scale (0.72), the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey physical functioning scale (0.33), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (0.03), the 25-ft Timed Walk Test (0.44), and Guy's Neurologic Disability Scale lower limb disability item (0.10). CONCLUSIONS: The MSWS-12 satisfies standard criteria as a reliable and valid patient-based measure of the impact of MS on walking. In these samples, the MSWS-12 was more responsive than other walking-based scales.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Diagnostic Techniques, Neurological/*standards, Disability Evaluation, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*diagnosis/physiopathology, Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive/diagnosis/physiopathology, Predictive Value of Tests, Psychometrics, Questionnaires, Reproducibility of Results, *Severity of Illness Index, *Walking/classification",-1

It has been recently recognized that abrupt withdrawal from ITB may, in rare cases, result in life-threatening rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, autonomic disturbances, and sepsis-like presentations. Early recognition of the most severe forms of the withdrawal syndrome is essential for effective intervention. The common and unique features in such individuals seem to be severe increased spasticity and marked elevation in creatinine kinase levels. This case of an individual with T4 paraplegia with recurrent episodes of ITB withdrawal associated with severe spasticity and elevated creatinine kinase levels who required rapid weaning of high-dose ITB to allow removal of an infected pump and catheter illustrates the value of monitoring creatinine kinase levels in evaluation of suspected ITB withdrawal and during rapid weaning of ITB when necessary.","Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, Creatine Kinase/*blood, Equipment Contamination, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable/microbiology, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/etiology, Paraplegia/complications, Staphylococcus/isolation & purification, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*blood",-1
12074349,Chloride increases adrenergic receptor-mediated platelet and vascular responses.,"Vaitkevicius H, Turner I, Spalding A, Lockette W",Am J Hypertens. 2002 Jun;15(6):492-8.,"BACKGROUND: We postulated that increasing intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl-]i) in human platelets would potentiate alpha2 adrenergic receptor (A2AR)-mediated platelet aggregation, and that vascular reactivity would also be increased by raising [Cl-]i in blood vessels. We further hypothesized that ligands binding to the A2AR would increase [Cl-]i by stimulating carbonic anhydrase-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchange. Because diuretics are potent inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase, we speculated that these agents inhibit platelet aggregation and vascular contractility through inhibition of chloride influx by decreasing carbonic anhydrase activity, and subsequently, chloride/bicarbonate exchange. The aim of this study was to test these hypotheses. METHODS: Platelet aggregation was measured by determining changes in optical density of platelet-rich plasma. Contractile responses to A2AR agonists were recorded in isolated vascular smooth muscle. The substances [Cl-]i and intracellular pH (pHi) were measured using microfluorometric methods. Carbonic anhydrase activity and chloride/bicarbonate exchange were determined by an in vitro assay based on the Stewart cycle. RESULTS: Increasing [Cl-]i potentiated platelet aggregation and vascular contractility, and epinephrine raised [Cl-]i by stimulating carbonic anhydrase-dependent chloride/bicarbonate exchange. Furthermore, diuretic-dependent inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity decreased chloride/bicarbonate exchange. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the concept that diuretics inhibit carbonic anhydrase activity and chloride/bicarbonate exchange in platelets and vascular smooth muscle. The ensuing reduction in [Cl-]i that is induced by diuretics in these tissues could play a role in reducing the effect of catecholamines on precipitating thrombotic stroke or myocardial infarction.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*pharmacology, Animals, Benzothiadiazines, Blood Platelets/drug effects/physiology, Carbonic Anhydrases/*drug effects/physiology, Chloride-Bicarbonate Antiporters/*drug effects/physiology, Clonidine/*pharmacology, Diuretics, Epinephrine/pharmacology, Humans, Male, Muscle Contraction/drug effects, Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/*drug effects, Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects/physiology, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha/*drug effects/physiology, Sodium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors/pharmacology, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",-1

RESULTS: After gabapentin treatment (3,000 mg orally daily) the horizontal nystagmus was significantly reduced, and the patient developed a marked chin-up position. The vertical nystagmus remained unchanged, dampening on downgaze. A recession of both inferior rectus muscles reduced the nystagmus significantly in primary position, the abnormal head position disappeared, and oscillopsia completely resolved. Treatment increased visual acuity from 6/24 in the right eye and 6/60 in the left eye to 6/9 in both eyes.

During a 5-year period, 1992 to 1997, serum samples of CIT and desmethylcitalopram (DCIT) were collected for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) from patients from all over Sweden. These samples were accompanied by clinical information on a specially designed TDM request form. They represented men and women of various ages (11-94 years) usually on multiple concomitant medications and treated in a naturalistic setting. The TDM samples eligible for evaluation (n = 749), all trough values at steady state, were studied with respect to inter- and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability. Extensive, interindividual serum concentration variability was seen on all dose levels. For dose-corrected concentrations (C/D) and for clearance (Cl) we found the coefficient of variation (CV) to be approximately 55% for all variables (C/D CIT, C/D DCIT, the ratio DCIT to CIT, and for Cl CIT). The intraindividual variations over time for the same parameters were 30% to 35%. On a population level, signs of a possible saturation of CYP2D6 associated with increasing DCIT-to-CIT ratios with increasing daily doses was observed. Age and gender affected the pharmacokinetics of CIT and DCIT. Women showed significantly higher C/D CIT and C/D DCIT and lower Cl CIT values compared with men, and patients aged more than 65 years had higher C/D CIT and C/D DCIT and lower Cl CIT values compared with younger patients. Finally, concomitant medication affected the outcome of serum concentrations by a general increase in C/D CIT and C/D DCIT but without alteration in the DCIT-to-CIT ratio. Thus, this tendency of changes in the CIT disposition when multiple drugs are used (and multiple diseases are prevailing?) seems more general in character than specific for a certain drug or type of drugs.","Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Body Mass Index, Child, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Citalopram/*analogs &, derivatives/blood/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Interactions, Drug Monitoring, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Sex Factors, Smoking/metabolism, Stereoisomerism",-1

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, multigroup study. SETTING: Research animal laboratory. SUBJECTS: Yorkshire piglets (n = 16), 4 to 5 wks of age, 3.5 to 4.5 kg of body weight. INTERVENTIONS: Animals were slowly heated with a radiant heat source to 43 degrees C and then maintained at this temperature for 30 mins. The animals were then removed from the heat source and randomized into one of four groups to receive either conventional cooling methods consisting of fluid resuscitation with 0.9% sodium chloride solution, sponging with room temperature water, mechanical fanning, and gastric lavage with iced 0.9% sodium chloride solution (group 1), conventional cooling methods and dantrolene (group 2), conventional cooling methods and dantrolene's vehicle mannitol (group 3), or no treatment (group 4). Cooling times, defined as the time required to reach a core body temperature of 38.5 degrees C, and cardiovascular parameters for each group were then compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Animals in groups 1, 2, and 3 had significantly (p < .05) lower core body temperatures than animals that received no treatment at the conclusion of the experiment. Piglets in groups 2 and 3 had faster cooling times than piglets in group 1 (p < .05). However, there was no statistically significant difference in cooling times between the animals in groups 2 and 3. There were no statistically significant differences in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, or systemic vascular resistance index between animals in groups 1, 2, or 3. Group 3 piglets had higher cardiac indices and stroke indices than the piglets in the other groups (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic interventions with conventional cooling or conventional cooling and dantrolene provided significant improvement in cardiovascular function in an immature porcine heatstroke model. Dantrolene, given with conventional cooling methods, offered no significant improvement in cardiovascular parameters compared with conventional cooling methods alone. Dantrolene significantly shortened the cooling time compared with conventional cooling but did not significantly shorten the cooling time compared with its vehicle, mannitol. Although dantrolene significantly shortened the cooling time, it did not appear to be superior compared with conventional cooling methods in treating heatstroke in this immature porcine heatstroke model.","Animals, Body Temperature/*drug effects, Cardiovascular System/*drug effects, Dantrolene/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, *Disease Models, Animal, Fluid Therapy, Heat Stroke/*drug therapy/*physiopathology/therapy, Hemodynamics, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Swine, Time Factors",-1

12468583,Increase in Cx45 gap junction channels in cerebral smooth muscle cells from SHR.,"Li X, Simard JM",Hypertension. 2002 Dec;40(6):940-6.,"We recently reported the novel finding of expression and function of connexin45 (Cx45) in cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. We examined the hypothesis that Cx45 is altered in hypertension. Immunoblots for Cx45 showed a significant increase in Cx45 in cerebral arteries from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) compared with adult Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, with no difference in aorta or femoral artery. Patch-clamp of cerebral smooth muscle cells pairs from SHR versus WKY showed a significantly steeper voltage dependence of deactivation and partial block of junctional currents by quinine and by a peptide that interferes with docking of Cx45, consistent with dominance of functional Cx45 channels in SHR. We examined potential roles of blood pressure versus angiotensin in elevated Cx45 in SHR by measuring Cx45 protein in 4 groups: (1) long-term administration in Wistar rats of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME; (2) long-term administration in SHR of the ACE inhibitor captopril; (3) long-term administration in Wistar rats of angiotensin; and (4) exposure of basilar artery segments in organ culture to angiotensin. Blood pressure was significantly elevated in groups 1 and 3 and was normal in group 2. In groups 1, 2, and 4, there was no significant change in Cx45 protein. In group 3, there was a modest but insignificant increase in Cx45 protein but no change in voltage dependence of deactivation of junctional currents. Overall, our data show increased Cx45 in SHR that is unlikely to be due to either elevated blood pressure or to angiotensin. Relative dominance of Cx45 over Cx43 in cerebral vessels may predispose SHR to ischemic stroke.","Angiotensin II/pharmacology, Animals, Aorta/cytology/metabolism, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Brain/*blood supply, Cell Line/cytology, Cerebral Arteries/cytology/drug effects/metabolism, Connexin 43/biosynthesis, Connexins/*metabolism, Disease Models, Animal, Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology, Female, Femoral Artery/cytology/metabolism, Gap Junctions/drug effects/*metabolism, Humans, Hypertension/chemically induced/*physiopathology, Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism, Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors, Patch-Clamp Techniques, Quinine/pharmacology, Rats, Rats, Inbred SHR, Rats, Inbred WKY",-1
7665718,Is quinine effective and safe in leg cramps?,"Mandal AK, Abernathy T, Nelluri SN, Stitzel V",J Clin Pharmacol. 1995 Jun;35(6):588-93.,"Muscle cramp is a recurrent and painful condition and a common complaint among elderly subjects and patients treated with hemodialysis. It is commonly nocturnal and can disturb a good night's sleep. No specific cause can be identified; therefore, therapy is mostly symptomatic. Quinine sulfate, an antimalarial drug, is widely used as an effective therapy for idiopathic leg cramps. Several double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have questioned the effectiveness of quinine in leg cramps; whereas other studies have shown significantly more benefit with use of quinine in reducing the frequency and severity of cramps compared with placebo or vitamin E. The mechanism of this beneficial effect is obscure, however. Quinine appears to decrease the excitability of the motor end plate, thereby reducing the muscle contractility. Most patients consider quinine beneficial for their leg cramps, which is difficult to refute by scientific data. More important, cramp is a subjective symptom, therefore difficult to measure objectively. Consequently, scientific studies designed to prove or disprove the effectiveness of quinine can be subject to flaws. Further, a dosage of 200 to 300 mg of quinine every night has not been shown to cause significant side effects. Nevertheless, quinine should be used in a small dose and cautiously, especially in the elderly and patients with renal failure, and should be avoided in patients with liver disease.","Aged, Double-Blind Method, Drug Interactions, Humans, Leg, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy/etiology, Quinine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Renal Dialysis/adverse effects, Time Factors, Vitamin E/therapeutic use",-1

The patients were randomly assigned to two equal groups to receive either urapidil (0.4 mg.kg-1) or clonidine (2.5 micrograms.kg-1). Neither patient had congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, previous myocardial infarction, nor was any being treated with beta-blocking agents or with amiodarone. Usual anti-anginal medication (nifedipine and isosorbide) was maintained up to the time of the procedure. Monitoring was obtained from ECG, Swan-Ganz catheter fitted out with a fast response-thermistor, and radial artery cannula. Blood samples were withdrawn for plasma atrial natriuretic factor determination. Thirty minutes after catheter insertion, baseline data were collected in supine and 45 degrees head-up tilt positions. Following urapidil or clonidine i.v. injection, three series of measurements (3, 8 and 13 min) were made in supine and tilt positions according to a randomized sequence. The two groups were similar with regard to age, weight, height, coronary artery disease and treatment. Urapidil and clonidine elicited a similar decrease in mean arterial pressure of 14% in supine position and 20% in head-up tilt position, combined with an exclusive decrease in systolic index i.e. not associated with a change in peripheral vascular resistances. Despite the decrease in arterial pressure, heart rate remained unchanged.

METHODS: Children (aged 6-12 years) with treatment-resistant partial-onset seizures receiving one standard antiepileptic drug (AED) were eligible. After a 4-week baseline period, children received LEV in a 6-week titration phase (target dose, 40 mg/kg/day) followed by an 8-week evaluation phase. Seizure frequency during the evaluation period with individualized LEV doses (20-40 mg/kg/day) were compared with the 4-week baseline seizure frequency. Plasma concentrations of LEV and other AEDs were determined to evaluate potential drug interactions. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects enrolled and received LEV; 23 entered the evaluation phase, and 22 completed the evaluation phase. Compared with their baseline seizure frequency, 12 (52%) of 23 subjects entering the evaluation phase had their seizure frequency decrease by >50%. Two subjects remained seizure free during the entire evaluation period. LEV did not significantly affect plasma concentrations of any concomitant AED during this study, and no alteration of mean clinical laboratory values was observed. The most commonly reported adverse events were headache, infection, anorexia, and somnolence. CONCLUSIONS: This open-label study of adjunctive LEV therapy (at 20-40 mg/kg/day) suggests that LEV is effective, safe, and well tolerated in children ages 6-12 years with treatment-resistant partial-onset seizures. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of LEV adjunctive therapy in children with treatment-resistant partial-onset seizures is needed and ongoing to confirm these open-label findings.","Age Factors, Age of Onset, Anorexia/chemically induced, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use, Child, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsies, Partial/blood/*drug therapy, Female, Headache/chemically induced, Humans, Infection/chemically induced, Male, Piracetam/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*therapeutic use, Sleep Disorders/chemically induced, Treatment Outcome",-1

Gabapentin's potential role in the treatment of epilepsy also was assessed. DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE search was performed to identify all published literature (manuscripts and abstracts). Abstracts presented at the American Epilepsy Society, International Epilepsy Congress, and American Academy of Neurology meetings from 1991 to 1993 also were reviewed. A copy of the proceedings from the Food and Drug Administration Peripheral and Central Nervous System Advisory Committee meeting and package insert were obtained from Parke Davis. STUDY SELECTION: All pertinent literature was reviewed. Emphasis was placed on published information, particularly placebo-controlled clinical trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Gabapentin is effective as adjunctive treatment for patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization refractory to the standard AEDs. It has a unique pharmacokinetic profile for an AED, including no binding to plasma proteins, primary elimination by the kidney, and dose-dependent oral absorption at high dosages. No drug interactions occur with the other AEDs. The most frequent adverse reactions noted in patients receiving gabapentin have been mild and transient central nervous system effects. No serious hypersensitivity or systemic reactions have been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to be a useful new AED. Further studies evaluating its use as monotherapy, in higher dosages, and in pediatric and elderly patients are required to better delineate its therapeutic role relative to that of other AEDs.","Acetates/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Adult, Age Factors, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Interactions, Epilepsies, Partial/drug therapy, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Humans, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

The newer antifungal agents-itraconazole, terbinafine, and fluconazole-appear to be effective and safe for the treatment of tinea capitis. When tinea capitis is due to T. tonsurans or other endothrix species the following regimens have been used: itraconazole continuous regimen (5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks), itraconazole pulse regimen with capsules (5 mg/kg/day for 1 week plus 1-3 pulses 3 weeks apart), and itraconazole pulse regimen with oral solution (3 mg/kg/day for 1 week plus 1-3 pulses 3 weeks apart). With terbinafine tablets the continuous regimen (>40 kg body weight, 250 mg/day; 20-40 kg, 125 mg/day; and <20 kg, 125 mg/day) is given for 2 to 4 weeks. Fluconazole tablets or oral suspension (6 mg/kg/day) were administered for 20 days in one trial. Another possibility may be 6 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks and evaluating the scalp 4 weeks later. An extra week of therapy (6 mg/kg/day) can be administered if clinically indicated at that time. A once-weekly regimen may also be effective. When ectothrix organisms (e.g., Microsporum canis) are present, a longer duration of therapy may be required. The data suggest that the newer agents are effective, safe with few adverse effects, and have a high benefit:risk ratio. It remains to be seen to what extent griseofulvin will be superseded for the treatment of tinea capitis. Adjunctive therapies may help decrease the risk of infection to other individuals. Appropriate measures should be taken to reduce the possibility of reinfection.","Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use, Fluconazole/therapeutic use, Griseofulvin/therapeutic use, Humans, Itraconazole/therapeutic use, Ketoconazole/therapeutic use, Naphthalenes/therapeutic use, Tinea Capitis/*drug therapy/pathology",-1

There were 13 patients, 7 females, who had paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), 10 with attacks lasting 5 minutes or less (short lasting) and 3 with attacks lasting longer than 5 minutes (long lasting). Twenty-six patients, 18 females, had paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), 9 with short-lasting and 17 with long-lasting PNKD. Five patients, 3 females, had paroxysmal exertion-induced dyskinesia (PED), 3 with short-lasting PED and the other 2 with long-lasting PED. In addition, there was 1 patient with paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) and 1 with paroxysmal superior oblique myokymia. Only 2 patients, 1 with PKD and 1 with PHD, had family history of paroxysmal dyskinesias. No specific cause could be identified in 21 patients; in the other 23 patients the etiologies included the following: psychogenic (9 patients), cerebrovascular diseases (4), multiple sclerosis (2), encephalitis (2), cerebral trauma (2), peripheral trauma (2), migraine (1), and kernicterus (1). Nine of 10 (90%) patients with PKD improved with medications, mostly anticonvulsants, compared with only 7 of 19 (37%) with PNKD. This new classification, based chiefly on precipitating events, allowed appropriate categorization of the attacks in all our patients with paroxysmal dyskinesias.","Adolescent, Adult, Age of Onset, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Middle Aged, Movement Disorders/*classification/drug therapy/*physiopathology",-1
10940092,Effectiveness of amitriptyline in the prophylactic management of childhood headaches.,"Hershey AD, Powers SW, Bentti AL, Degrauw TJ",Headache. 2000 Jul-Aug;40(7):539-49.,"OBJECTIVE: To study the effectiveness of a standardized dose of amitriptyline, 1 mg/kg, for childhood headaches. BACKGROUND: Amitriptyline has been shown to be effective for the prophylaxis of migraine in adults. Studies in children, however, have been quite limited. In adults, the suggested effective dose range is 10 to 150 mg. In children, a standardized dosage is often not used, resulting in a dosage range in clinical practice that often varies from a very low dose to a dose equivalent to that used in adults. METHODS: Children with more than three headaches per month were treated with amitriptyline, slowly increasing the dose to 1 mg/kg per day. The frequency, severity, and duration of their headaches were initially evaluated and subsequently measured at each follow-up evaluation. Two hundred seventy-nine children had headaches occurring frequently enough to indicate prophylactic treatment. Of these children, 192 (68.8%) were treated with amitriptyline. The average age at presentation was 12.0 (+/- 3.0) years. The ratio of boys to girls was 1:1.74. The average frequency of headaches was 17.1 (+/- 10.1) days per month. The average severity was 6.84 (+/- 1.67) on a 10-point pain scale. The average duration was 11.5 (+/- 15.0) hours. The most frequent diagnoses using International Headache Society criteria were migraine (60.6%), migraine with aura (7.9%), and tension-type headache (10.4%). Of these children, 146 have been seen for at least one follow-up examination, occurring on average 67.3 (+/- 32.3) days after beginning prophylactic treatment. RESULTS: A total of 84.2% of the children reported an overall perception of being better, while 11.6% reported being the same. The frequency of headaches improved to 9.2 (+/- 10.0) days per month. The average severity was reduced to 5.1 (+/- 2.1), and the average duration was reduced to 6.3 (+/- 11.1) hours. If daily or continuous headaches were excluded, the improvements were more marked. Minimal side effects were reported from these children and their families. Long-term evaluation (156 to 415 days) showed continued sustained improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Amitriptyline is an effective prophylactic medication for children with frequent headaches. A standardized dosing regimen results in a significant number of children responding with minimal side effects. The children are able to tolerate this dosing scheme and demonstrate good adherence to a dosing schedule of once a day.","Amitriptyline/*therapeutic use, Child, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Headache Disorders/*drug therapy, Humans, Male, Migraine Disorders/*prevention & control, Prospective Studies, Recurrence",-1
11806403,Social functioning and quality of life in the schizophrenic patient: advantages of amisulpride.,"Saleem P, Olie JP, Loo H",Int Clin Psychopharmacol. 2002 Jan;17(1):1-8.,"Schizophrenia is associated with significant social, psychological and occupational dysfunction. Not only is this distressing for the patients and their family and friends, but it also results in high indirect costs. Reintegration back into society, one of the most important aspects of quality life for schizophrenic patients and their physicians, must therefore take into account a patient's social functioning and employability, as well as improvement in symptoms. Although the typical antipsychotics are effective in managing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, they may not alleviate other aspects of the disorder. They are also associated with extrapyramidal symptoms and other severe adverse events that have significant consequences for quality of life and compliance. The atypical antipsychotic, amisulpride, has an improved safety and tolerability profile and has been shown to be significantly more effective than placebo and haloperidol on a number of quality of life and social functioning scales, including the Global Assessment of Functioning, the Quality of Life Scale, the Functional Status Questionnaire and the Psychosocial Aptitude Rating Scale. In conclusion, amisulpride, in addition to its proven clinical efficacy, may help reintegration of the schizophrenic patient back into society.","Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Humans, *Quality of Life, Schizophrenia/*drug therapy, *Schizophrenic Psychology, *Social Behavior, Sulpiride/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use",-1

In this consecutive series, we report on data collected from structured interviews with 85 patients seen within a 16-month period at a regional referral clinic. The prevalence of pain for the month preceding assessment was 53%. There were no significant differences between patients who did and those who did not report pain on the basis of patient demographics (age, gender) and disease characteristics (disease subtype, duration and neurologic symptom severity). Disease duration and neurologic symptom severity were significantly correlated with the number of hours of pain per week but were not correlated with pain severity, the number of pain sites or pain-related distress. There was wide variability in the number of pain hours/week reported with 17.6% of the sample reporting continuous pain for the month preceding assessment. Sixty-five percent of patients with pain reported taking medications for pain and 90% of these patients evaluated their medication(s) as 50% effective or better. Nevertheless, patients with pain reported poorer mental health and more social-role handicap. Discussion focuses on the need for routine assessment of pain and the comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of pain interventions in the therapeutic management of patients with MS.","Adult, Aged, Disability Evaluation, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications/psychology, Pain/*etiology/psychology, Pain Measurement, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Recurrence",-1

DESIGN: A meta-analysis of six randomised, double blind, crossover trials. SETTING: Randomised trials that were available as of April 1994. SUBJECTS: A total of 107 general ambulatory patients who suffered from regular nocturnal leg cramps from six clinical trials. RESULTS: Data from individual patients were used to calculate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each of the outcome measures reported by these studies. Treatment with quinine resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cramps for a four week period compared with placebo (8.83 fewer cramps; 95% confidence interval 4.16 to 13.49). Treatment with quinine reduced the number of nights with cramps by 27.4% (24.0% to 30.8%) compared with placebo. Treatment did not produce a significant change in the severity or duration of individual nocturnal leg cramps. Side effects were uncommon. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that quinine can prevent nocturnal leg cramps in general ambulatory populations. Given the possible serious side effects of treatment with quinine, the benefits and risks in patients taking this drug should be closely monitored.","Aged, Circadian Rhythm/physiology, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, *Leg, Male, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy, Quinine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",1
9137841,"Migraine prophylactic drugs: proof of efficacy, utilization and cost.","Ramadan NM, Schultz LL, Gilkey SJ",Cephalalgia. 1997 Apr;17(2):73-80.,"OBJECTIVES: In order to understand the pattern of utilization of migraine prophylactic drugs by US physicians, we reviewed the scientific rigor of published trials of anti-migraine medications, assessed their cost, and tested the correlation, if any, between utilization, scientific rigor and cost. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scientific rigor of published reports. We identified all placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trials of migraine prophylactic agents through Medline search, major Headache textbooks and proceedings of major scientific meetings where headache-related topics are discussed. We excluded trials that did not include placebo treatment during the active phase of the study. The trials were reviewed and rated for scientific rigor using a 5-point scale (scientific score [ss]; 1 = low, 5 = good), blinded to the physicians' utilization data and cost of the drugs. Studies that did not show benefit of the active drug over placebo were scored -1 to -5, thus allowing for the reverse logic of negative studies. US physicians utilization. Neurologists and primary care physicians (PCP) completed phone-mail-phone questionnaires which inquired about first and second choices of migraine prophylaxis. These choices were averaged to obtain a weighted average percent usage of each drug. Cost. The average wholesale price (AWP) of each drug was obtained from data published by Adelman and Von Seggern, and from the Amerisource (7/9/96) catalog. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the relationship between the average ss, physician use, and cost of each drug. RESULTS: Propranolol (ss = 1.44), amitriptyline (ss = 2.33) and verapamil (ss = 1.00) were the three preferred migraine prophylactic drugs by both neurologists and PCPs. Approximately 10% of neurologists said that divalproex (ss = 3.75) would be their first or second choice. The selective serotonin reuptake blockers were favored by 13.21% of PCPs. All other prophylactic drugs were felt to be first or second line of treatment by less than 10% of either neurologists or PCPs. Except for one study (ss = 1) that showed that propranolol reduced the migraine frequency by 76% over placebo, trials of the three most preferred medications failed to demonstrate that the active drug is > 50% better than placebo, i.e. the difference in headache frequency when on placebo vs active drug is > 50%. Of the drugs available in the United States, flurbiprofen and metoprolol achieved the best ss (5.00 and 4.33, respectively) but their efficacy over placebo (23% and 14-33%, respectively) and cost ($67.2 and $65.6) were unfavorable. Neurologists and PCPs chose migraine prophylaxis on the basis of scientific merit (r = 0.644, p = 0.018; r = 0.576, p = 0.05, respectively) but not cost (r = -0.254, p = 0.45; r = -0.255, p = 0.455). CONCLUSION: The three most commonly chosen migraine prophylactic agents have not been shown irrefutably to prevent migraine. Furthermore, their benefit, if any, does not exceed 50% over placebo. The well-conducted recent trials that demonstrated the efficacy of divalproex in migraine prevention are steps in the right direction of finding the ""ideal migraine preventative agent"". Until that drug is discovered, it is difficult to argue that one migraine prophylactic medication is superior to another and accordingly should be used as a first line of treatment.","Adult, Amitriptyline/economics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Male, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy/*prevention & control, Propranolol/economics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Verapamil/economics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use",-1
11523691,Subfascial implantation of intrathecal baclofen pumps in children: technical note.,"Kopell BH, Sala D, Doyle WK, Feldman DS, Wisoff JH, Weiner HL",Neurosurgery. 2001 Sep;49(3):753-6; discussion 756-7.,"OBJECTIVE: Indwelling intrathecal drug delivery systems are becoming increasingly important as a method of neuromodulation within the nervous system. In particular, intrathecal baclofen therapy has shown efficacy and safety in the management of spasticity and dystonia in children. The most common complications leading to explantation of the pumps are skin breakdown and infection at the pump implantation site. The pediatric population poses particular challenges with regard to these complications because appropriate candidates for intrathecal baclofen therapy are often undernourished and thus have a dearth of soft tissue mass to cover a subcutaneously implanted baclofen pump. We report a technique of subfascial implantation that provides greater soft tissue coverage of the pump, thereby reducing the potential for skin breakdown and improving the cosmetic appearance of the implantation site. METHODS: Eighteen consecutively treated children (average age, 8 yr, 7 mo) with spasticity and/or dystonia underwent subfascial implantation of a baclofen pump. These children's mean weight of 42.9 lb is less than the expected weight for a group of children in this age group, ranging from 4 years, 8 months, to 15 years, 7 months. In all patients, the pump was inserted into a pocket surgically constructed between the rectus abdominus and the external oblique muscles and the respective anterior fascial layers. RESULTS: At an average follow-up of 13.7 months, no infection or skin breakdown had occurred at the pump surgical site in any of the 18 patients. CONCLUSION: At this early follow-up, the subfascial implantation technique was associated with a reduced rate of local wound and pump infections and provided optimal cosmetic results as compared with that observed in retrospective cases.","Adolescent, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Dystonia/*drug therapy, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Monitoring, Intraoperative, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy",-1

Forty-five patients with vestibular neuronitis (VN) served as a control group. METHODS: In addition to a clinical examination, the patients filled out a questionnaire concerning their headache. RESULTS: Altogether 60 MD patients (70%) and 26 VN patients (58%) reported headache. Headache was severe in 35 MD patients (58%), moderate in 16 patients (27%) and slight in nine MD patients (15%), and as a whole more severe than that of the VN patients (P < 0.01). The MD patients exhibited significantly more occipital (P < 0.005) and neck headache (P < 0.005) than the VN patients. Analgesics had been used by 82%, antidepressants by 35%, sumatriptan by 13% and carbamazepine and/or amitriptyline by 12% of the MD patients suffering from headache. Pain relief was reported as good by 27%, satisfactory by 60%, poor by 5% of the MD patients and 8% could not rate the pain relief. In this study migraine was diagnosed in 5 MD patients. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that MD is associated with headache that can be handicapping, and tricyclic antidepressants with pain alleviating medication is often needed to treat the headache in MD whereas sumatriptan did not alleviate the headache of the non-migraine patients.","Adult, Aged, Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, Carbamazepine/therapeutic use, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Headache/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology, Humans, Male, Meniere Disease/*complications/diagnosis, Middle Aged, Questionnaires, Retrospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Sumatriptan/therapeutic use, Vasoconstrictor Agents/therapeutic use, Vestibular Neuronitis/diagnosis",-1

12387706,Fabry disease: recent advances in enzyme replacement therapy.,Germain DP,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2002 Oct;11(10):1467-76.,"Fabry disease is an X-linked inherited disorder of metabolism due to mutations in the gene encoding alpha-galactosidase A, a lysosomal enzyme. The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of incompletely metabolised glycosphingolipids, primarily globotriaosylceramide, in plasma and lysosomes within various tissues. Inability to prevent the progression of glycosphingolipid deposition causes significant morbidity, associated with significant impact on quality of life and diminished lifespan from early onset strokes, heart attack and progressive renal failure. The disease manifests primarily in hemizygous males; however, there is increasing recognition that heterozygous (carrier) females may also develop disease-related complications. Indeed, most heterozygotes present with cardiac, renal or neurological symptoms, although with later-onset and to a lesser extent than is observed in hemizygotes. Until recently, medical management was symptomatic, consisting of partial pain relief with analgesic drugs (carbamazepin, gabapentin), kidney and vascular protection with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and folic acid, whereas renal transplantation or dialysis is available for patients experiencing end stage renal failure. The ability to produce high doses of alpha-galactosidase A has opened the way to preclinical studies, and enzyme replacement therapy has recently been validated as a therapeutic agent in clinical trials. Long-term safety and efficacy of replacement therapy are currently being investigated. Increasing knowledge of the natural history of Fabry disease and greater experience with enzyme therapy should enable optimal patient care. The complexity and relative rarity of Fabry disease necessitates a multi-disciplinary team approach that may be facilitated by a disease registry.","Animals, Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/statistics & numerical data, Fabry Disease/*drug therapy/enzymology, Humans, Technology, Pharmaceutical/*trends, alpha-Galactosidase/*therapeutic use",-1

The initial pharmacological approach to treating the disorder is the management of the pain. Tricyclic antidepressants are the most effective drugs in use so far, especially when administered in combination with other therapies (e.g., selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors), which suggests modulation of the neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline. The effectiveness of amitriptyline and related tricyclic antidepressants, however, is consistent with the involvement of mechanisms, such as potassium channel modulation and NMDA receptor antagonism, in addition to or in place of the modulation of monoamine neurotransmitters. Investigation of the importance of each of the pharmacological properties of amitriptyline and related molecules in the management of fibromyalgia could provide clues for the rational design of new drugs.","Animals, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use, Biogenic Monoamines/antagonists & inhibitors, Fibromyalgia/complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Humans, Pain/complications/drug therapy, Sleep Disorders, Intrinsic/complications/drug therapy",-1

The goal of antiepileptic drug therapy is to control seizures but preserve quality of life. If possible, seizure control should be achieved with one agent given in the lowest effective dosage. Clinical response, rather than drug levels, should guide dosage changes. All antiepileptic drugs can cause dose-dependent sedation and cognitive impairment. Although the newer agents may have theoretical advantages over standard antiepileptic agents, higher cost may limit their use.

12962348,Medications in pregnancy and lactation.,"Della-Giustina K, Chow G",Emerg Med Clin North Am. 2003 Aug;21(3):585-613.,"Lack of information and misinformation often lead to physicians advising mothers to discontinue breastfeeding because of medication use. Also, many mothers do not adhere to their prescriptions or quit breastfeeding because of medication use. Although in both cases this cessation of breastfeeding is probably based on concern for the infant's safety, the physician may also be influenced by expediency and fear of litigation. The safest course for physicians who are treating nursing mothers is to consult reliable sources before advising discontinuation of breastfeeding. Overwhelming evidence has shown that breastfeeding is the most healthful form of nutrition for babies and should therefore be encouraged by physicians. Physicians should take the following approach to maximize safe maternal medication use for both the mother and the breastfed infant: 1. Determine if medication is necessary. 2. Choose the safest drug available, that is, one that; is safe when administered directly to infants, has a low milk:plasma ratio, has a short half-life, has a high molecular weight, has high protein binding in maternal serum, is ionized in maternal plasma, is less lipophilic. 3. Consultation with the infant's pediatrician is encouraged. 4. Advise the mother to take the medication just after she has breastfed the infant or just before the infant's longest sleep period. 5. If there is a possibility that a drug may risk the health of the infant, arrange for the monitoring of serum drug levels in the infant. Emergency physicians are often faced with the daunting task of treating a large variety of high-acuity patients, including patients who happen to be pregnant or nursing mothers. Priority, of course, needs to be given to life-saving treatment. When physicians are treating pregnant or breastfeeding patients, they need to use reliable resources to evaluate the risks and benefits of the medication for the mother and the infant. Most medications should have no effect on milk supply or on infant well-being. In most cases, treatment plans for patients should include encouragement from the emergency physician that he or she has researched the chosen medicine and that breastfeeding may safely continue.","Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/prevention & control, Analgesics/pharmacology, Anti-Infective Agents/pharmacology, Anticoagulants/pharmacology, Female, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Lactation/*drug effects, Pharmaceutical Preparations/classification, Placenta/drug effects, Placental Circulation/drug effects, Pregnancy/*drug effects, Psychotropic Drugs/pharmacology, Teratogens/pharmacology",-1

Several types of drugs are used to treat FMS, but none are specifically approved for this indication. FMS appears to be strongly associated with depression or at least with some symptoms of depression, and antidepressants appear to be effective in the treatment of this disorder.

7893219,Botulinum toxin A for trismus in cephalic tetanus.,"Andrade LA, Brucki SM",Arq Neuropsiquiatr. 1994 Sep;52(3):410-3.,"Cephalic tetanus is a localized form of tetanus. As in generalized forms, trismus is a prominent feature of the disease, leading to considerable difficulty in feeding, swallowing of the saliva and mouth hygiene. These difficulties often precede respiratory problems and aspiration bronchopneumonia is a frequent life-threatening complication. Muscle relaxants other than curare drugs may show a limited benefit for relieving trismus. Tetanospasmin, the tetanic neurotoxin, and botulinum toxin share many similarities, having a closely related chemical structure, an origin from related microorganisms (Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum, respectively), and presumably, the same mechanisms of action in the neuron. The difference between the two lies in their peculiar neurospecificity, acting in different neurons.

By December 2000, Pfizer anticipated filing an NDA for pregabalin for seven major indications (beginning with neuropathic pain and add-on epilepsy), with the FDA by the end of 2001. Filings for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia are expected to take place in 2002, and filings for epilepsy monotherapy and panic disorders are expected to take place in early- and late-2003, respectively [336918], [393182], [399956]. By January 2001, pregabalin was in phase II development in Japan for the potential treatment of neuropathic pain, with an anticipated approval date of 2005 [394827]. However, following analysis by the FDA of a mouse study that showed incidence of a specific tumor type, Pfizer announced in February 2001, that it is restricting the use of pregablin in some clinical patients [398726] and it has frozen trials for neuropathic pain [398785].

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of medical records of adults presenting with DKA between 1987 and 1993. The medical record was reviewed to classify patients as type I, type II, or newly diagnosed diabetics and to determine the status of diabetic treatment following the episode of DKA in those patients without prior history of type I diabetes. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-six patients were included in the study; 106 (47%) were classified as type I and 58 (26%) as type II from data available in the medical record, and 62 (27%) had DKA as the initial manifestation of the disease. Nineteen percent of the patients in whom diabetes was a new diagnosis and 52% of the patients who had a prior history of NIDDM were > or = 40 years old. Of patients with follow-up of at least 12 months, about 24% of the newly diagnosed and 8% of those with a history of NIDDM were not taking insulin. CONCLUSION: DKA occurs in patients with type II diabetes. Older patients may present with clinically apparent type I diabetes. Some adults who present with DKA do not remain insulin dependent.","Adult, Age Distribution, Analysis of Variance, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/*diagnosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*diagnosis, Diabetic Ketoacidosis/drug therapy/*etiology, Female, Humans, Incidence, Insulin/therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies",-1

BACKGROUND: Phenyramidol is a moderately potent and relatively nontoxic analgesic with concomitant muscle-relaxant activity. A MEDLINE search in June 2003 revealed no reports associating hepatotoxicity with this agent. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old man was investigated because of elevated liver function test values on routine biochemical screening. He had no clinical symptoms. Other etiologies of hepatitis were appropriately ruled out, and elevated enzymes were ascribed to phenyramidol treatment. DISCUSSION: This is the first case published in the English language literature describing probable hepatotoxicity, according to the Naranjo probability scale, resulting from use of phenyramidol. The mechanism of phenyramidol-induced liver damage is unknown. Several features, such as the absence of predictable dose-dependent toxicity of phenyramidol in previous studies and the absence of hypersensitivity manifestations in our patient, are suggestive of a metabolic type of idiosyncratic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Phenyramidol should be considered as a drug that possibly causes hepatotoxicity.","Aged, Back Pain/drug therapy, Drug-Induced Liver Injury/*etiology, Humans, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Pyridines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use",-1

A second objective was to examine complication rates among the clinic's patients. No conclusions could be drawn as to the relation between QOL, various reported complications, and length of treatment. A rank order frequency of areas reported by respondents to have the greatest impact on their QOL could be extrapolated from the data collected. In addition, complication rates among the patients who responded to the survey could be reported. Surveys from 49 patients about their experiences with IB therapy were analyzed. Respondents included 30 adult and 19 pediatric patients. Thirty-six patients (73%) had used the IB pump for 1 year or more. The survey included questions about QOL, complications, and length of IB treatment. Forty-three respondents (88%) stated they felt that their QOL had improved with IB therapy. Four patients (8%) responded that they were not sure that it had, and only 2 patients (4%) said that IB had not improved their QOL. The most frequently reported positive effects on QOL were reported in the following areas: spasticity control without the sedative effect of oral medication; ease of care for caregivers; easier positioning; less pain/increased comfort; and improved patient transfers. High ratings of improvement in the patients' QOL were reported despite a reported overall complication rate of 39%. The most common complications cited were infection and catheter breakage or disconnect. The overall infection rate for respondents was 10% (5 patients of the 49 surveyed reported infection). The rate of catheter breakage or disconnect was also 10%. Despite the complications reported, 46 patients stated they would recommend baclofen treatment to others. Three patients did not respond to the question.

However, no activity at all was found before the end of the movement provocation for 0.3 seconds in >60% of the test situations, whereas muscle torque was recorded in all cases. Significantly higher resistive muscle torque (p = 0.049) was provoked during extension movement compared with that of flexion. On the contrary, the maximum muscle activity was significantly higher (p = 0.009) during flexion movement compared with that during extension, with no differences between muscle groups. The resistive muscle torque seems to measure the passive viscoelastic component rather then the active spastic component of the movement-provoked muscle resistance in our group of motor complete SCI individuals.","Adult, Electric Stimulation, *Electromyography, Humans, Injury Severity Score, Knee Joint/physiology, Linear Models, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Contraction/*physiology, Muscle Spasticity/*physiopathology, Prospective Studies, Quadriplegia/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*rehabilitation, Range of Motion, Articular/physiology, Reproducibility of Results, Sampling Studies, Sensitivity and Specificity, Time Factors, Torque",-1

Recent work about the distribution of the injected blood and theoretical considerations about the mechanism of action make this method suitable for the occlusion of spinal leakage even in the presence of an intrathecal catheter. In this note technical details are given for a successful therapy of lumbar cerebrospinal fluid fistula including the right positioning of the opening of the needle (cerebrospinal fluid can be expected intrathecally and epidurally) by injection of contrast medium first for myelography then for epidurography. In this procedure the (epidural) distribution of autologous blood can be indirectly controlled by compression of the dural sac.

This review summarizes therapeutic strategies against IFN-alpha associated psychiatric syndromes. Zolpidem or Zopiclon can be used for the treatment of sleeping disturbances. Serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors including citalopram or paroxetine were shown to be effective for acute treatment of IFN-alpha associated depression. The efficacy of prophylactic treatment for prevention of IFN-alpha induced depression has to be proven in future trials.

Preventing such cellular Ca2+ rises in the brain may reduce considerably the neuronal damage produced by stroke, head trauma, or epilepsy. Activation of NMDA receptors is instrumental in this type of neurotoxicity. Recent findings, discussed here by Istvan Mody and John MacDonald, indicate that a large proportion of the neurotoxic Ca2+ that enters nerve cells following NMDA receptor activation originates from an intracellular Ca2+ pool. The release of Ca2+ from this pool is sensitive to the skeletal muscle relaxant dantrolene, and this may constitute a novel and alternative therapeutic approach against NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity.","Animals, Calcium/*metabolism, Excitatory Amino Acids/*toxicity, Humans, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/drug effects/*physiology",-1
14619895,Paroxetine: new indication. In generalised anxiety: uncertain efficacy.,MISSING,Prescrire Int. 2003 Oct;12(67):175-7.,"(1) Generalised anxiety is defined as overwhelming anxiety lasting at least 6 months. (2) Psychological treatment should be tried first. When the patient fails to cope the first-line drug is a benzodiazepine such as diazepam, prescribed for a short period. (3) In France, generalised anxiety has now been added to the licensed indications of paroxetine, a ""selective"" serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant. Two placebo-controlled trials lasting 8 weeks showed a moderate improvement on the Hamilton anxiety score. Another trial showed no significant difference between the paroxetine and placebo groups. The clinical relevance of this improvement is unclear, however, and the trials suffered from methodological biases. Paroxetine has not been reliably compared with benzodiazepines, psychotherapy or buspirone in patients with generalised anxiety. (4) One trial showed 11% relapse in the paroxetine group and 40% in the placebo group during the 6 months following paroxetine withdrawal, among patients who had initially responded; once again, however, methodological flaws undermine these data. (5) The adverse effect profile of paroxetine in generalised anxiety is similar to its profile in other patients: in particular potentially serious drug interactions and withdrawal symptoms when treatment is stopped abruptly. (6) In practice, the standard drug therapy for generalised anxiety is a benzodiazepine such as diazepam. Paroxetine, whose clinical efficacy remains to be established in this setting, offers no tangible therapeutic advance.","Anxiety/*drug therapy, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Approval, France, Humans, Paroxetine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

Epub 2003 Apr 14.,"Malaria represents a medical emergency because it may rapidly progress to complications and death without prompt and appropriate treatment. Severe malaria is almost exclusively caused by Plasmodium falciparum. The incidence of imported malaria is increasing and the case fatality rate remains high despite progress in intensive care and antimalarial treatment. Clinical deterioration usually appears 3-7 days after onset of fever. Complications involve the nervous, respiratory, renal, and/or hematopoietic systems. Metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia are common systemic complications. Intravenous quinine and quinidine are the most widely used drugs in the initial treatment of severe falciparum malaria, whereas artemisinin derivatives are currently recommended for quinine-resistant cases. As soon as the patient is clinically stable and able to swallow, oral treatment should be given. The intravascular volume should be maintained at the lowest level sufficient for adequate systemic perfusion to prevent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Renal replacement therapy should be initiated early. Exchange blood transfusion has been suggested for the treatment of patients with severe malaria and high parasitemia.

Behavioral and pharmacological therapies each appear modestly effective, but data are lacking on their separate and combined effects. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of behavioral and pharmacological therapies, singly and combined, for chronic tension-type headaches. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized placebo-controlled trial conducted from August 1995 to January 1998 at 2 outpatient sites in Ohio. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred three adults (mean age, 37 years; 76% women) with diagnosis of chronic tension-type headaches (mean, 26 headache d/mo). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive tricyclic antidepressant (amitriptyline hydrochloride, up to 100 mg/d, or nortriptyline hydrochloride, up to 75 mg/d) medication (n = 53), placebo (n = 48), stress management (eg, relaxation, cognitive coping) therapy (3 sessions and 2 telephone contacts) plus placebo (n = 49), or stress management therapy plus antidepressant medication (n = 53). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly headache index scores calculated as the mean of pain ratings (0-10 scale) recorded by participants in a daily diary 4 times per day; number of days per month with at least moderate pain (pain rating >/=5), analgesic medication use, and Headache Disability Inventory scores, compared by intervention group. RESULTS: Tricyclic antidepressant medication and stress management therapy each produced larger reductions in headache activity, analgesic medication use, and headache-related disability than placebo, but antidepressant medication yielded more rapid improvements in headache activity. Combined therapy was more likely to produce clinically significant (>/=50%) reductions in headache index scores (64% of participants) than antidepressant medication (38% of participants; P =.006), stress management therapy (35%; P =.003), or placebo (29%; P =.001). On other measures the combined therapy and its 2 component therapies produced similar outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that antidepressant medication and stress management therapy are each modestly effective in treating chronic tension-type headaches. Combined therapy may improve outcome relative to monotherapy.","Adult, Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use, *Behavior Therapy, Chronic Disease, Cognitive Therapy, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Nortriptyline/therapeutic use, Relaxation Therapy, Stress, Psychological/prevention & control, Tension-Type Headache/*therapy",-1

Eighty-one percent of the patients improved with at least one injection session. Sixty-five percent of the injections produced transient weakness. We followed 37 of the patients for at least 2 years from the start of treatment, 24 of whom discontinued treatment because of inadequate response, loss of response, inaccessibility of a treatment provider, or the expense of the toxin. Women, who had a greater extent and longer duration of benefit than men, were more likely to continue treatment. The mean interval between injection sessions was 6 months. In most patients, we injected the toxin into the same combination of muscles at each session. The dose of toxin generally fluctuated within a range of 20 units. Side effects were mild and transient and unrelated to the long-term use of botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin injection is safe and effective for the long-term management of focal hand dystonia.","Adult, Aged, Botulinum Toxins/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Dystonia/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology, Female, Hand, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology, Time Factors, Treatment Outcome",1

This study investigated the 6-week and 1-year effectiveness of low dose amitriptyline (10-30 mg) for the treatment of patients with chronic temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain. Based on clinical examination, patients were divided into two groups: myofascial and mixed (myofascial and temporomandibular joint disorders). Baseline pain was assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain intensity and by the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Depression was assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) short form. Patient assessment of global treatment effectiveness was obtained after 6 weeks and 1 year of treatment by using a five-point ordinal scale: (1) worse, (2) unchanged, (3) minimally improved, (4) moderately improved, (5) markedly improved. The results showed a significant reduction for all pain scores after 6 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. The depression scores changed in depressed but not in non-depressed patients. Global treatment effectiveness showed significant improvement 6 weeks and 1 year post-treatment. However, pain and global treatment effectiveness were less improved at 1 year than at 6 weeks.","Adult, Amitriptyline/*therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Depression/drug therapy, Facial Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Female, Headache/drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain Measurement, Personality Inventory, Pilot Projects, Questionnaires, Temporomandibular Joint Disorders/complications/*drug therapy, Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome/drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

Thirty patients with old post-stroke spastic hemiparesis took part in the investigation. They were treated with tizanidine-mean daily dose 15.8 +/- 5.6 mg for a mean of 23.3 +/- 4.8 days. A questionnaire for assessment of subjective improvement after treatment used a 5-point scale. For standardization of the neurological examination 5-point scales were used to assess muscle tone, muscle force and tendon reflexes. A battery of neurophysiological methods was used to analyze different mechanisms of spasticity: for alpha motoneuron excitability--the F wave parameters; for presynaptic inhibition--the ratio of H reflex amplitudes before and after vibration of the achilles tendon (Hvibr/Hmax); for common interneuron activity--the flexor reflex parameters. Our results revealed that tizanidine reduces spastically increased muscle tone, but has no influence on muscle force, tendon reflexes, Babinski sign and ankle clonus. Tizanidine is supposed to act by increasing the presynaptic inhibition and decreasing of alpha motoneuron excitability. When spasticity has decreased presynaptic inhibition and increased motoneuron excitability, it is better to treat with tizanidine.","Adult, Aged, Cerebrovascular Disorders/*drug therapy, Clonidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives, Electromyography/drug effects, Female, H-Reflex/drug effects, Hemiplegia/*drug therapy, Humans, Interneurons/drug effects, Male, Middle Aged, Motor Neurons/drug effects, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Neural Inhibition/drug effects, Neurologic Examination/*drug effects",-1
9070194,Causes and outcome of mechanical ventilation in patients with hemispheric ischemic stroke.,"Wijdicks EF, Scott JP",Mayo Clin Proc. 1997 Mar;72(3):210-3.,"OBJECTIVE: To attempt to determine factors that influence outcome in mechanically ventilated patients with ischemic hemispheric stroke. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed data on 24 mechanically ventilated patients with an ischemic stroke in the territory of the middle cerebral artery, who had been admitted to a medical, neurologic, or neurosurgical intensive-care unit during the period between 1976 and 1994. RESULTS: The circumstances surrounding mechanical ventilation were generalized tonic-clonic seizures or status epilepticus (N = 6), progression to stupor and inability to protect the airway from brain swelling (N = 8), or--most commonly--bilateral pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure (N = 10). Of the 24 patients, 17 patients died (12 of neurologic causes and 5 of cardiac arrest or cardiac arrhythmias). Of the seven surviving patients, however, four with seizures and one with pulmonary edema were functionally independent. CONCLUSION: Three clinical scenarios generally underlie mechanical ventilation in patients with ischemic hemispheric stroke (generalized tonic-clonic seizures, brain swelling, and bilateral pulmonary edema). The outcome in patients with an ischemic hemispheric stroke and a subsequent need for mechanical ventilation is poor; however, survival and independent function are possible if seizures or pulmonary edema prompt ventilatory support.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Brain Ischemia/*complications, Cerebrovascular Disorders/complications/*etiology, Edema/complications, Female, Heart Failure/complications, Humans, Intensive Care Units, Male, Middle Aged, Pulmonary Edema/complications, *Respiration, Artificial, Respiratory Insufficiency/etiology/*therapy, Risk Factors, Seizures/complications, Treatment Outcome",-1

Increasing oestrogen levels in early pregnancy offer a protective effect against headache, particularly for women with migraine. However, some women continue to experience troublesome headache throughout pregnancy. Headache persisting at the end of the first trimester will usually continue without improvement for the remainder of pregnancy and should be treated. Safe and effective acute care treatment options include paracetamol, opioids and anti-emetics. The use of triptans during pregnancy is controversial and not broadly recommended.

12182688,Aging and intestinal motility: a review of factors that affect intestinal motility in the aged.,"O'Mahony D, O'Leary P, Quigley EM",Drugs Aging. 2002;19(7):515-27.,"Normal aging is associated with significant changes in the function of most organs and tissues. In this regard, the gastrointestinal tract is no exception. The purpose of this review is to detail the important age-related changes in motor function of the various parts of the gastrointestinal tract and to highlight some of the important motility changes that may occur, either in relation to common age-related disorders, or as a result of certain drugs commonly prescribed in the aged. A major confounding factor in the interpretation of motor phenomena throughout the gastrointestinal tract in this age group is the frequent coexistence of neurological, endocrinological and other disease states, which may be independently associated with dysmotility. Overall, current data are insufficient to implicate normal aging as a cause of dysmotility in the elderly. Normal aging is associated with various changes in gastrointestinal motility, but the clinical significance of such changes remains unclear. More important is the impact of various age-related diseases on gastrointestinal motility in the elderly: for example, long-standing diabetes mellitus may reduce gastric emptying in up to 50% of patients; depression significantly prolongs whole-gut transit time; hypothyroidism may prolong oro-caecal transit time; and chronic renal failure is associated with impaired gastric emptying. In addition, various, frequently used drugs in the elderly cause disordered gastrointestinal motility. These drugs include anticholinergics, especially antidepressants with an anticholinergic effect, opioid analgesics and calcium antagonists.","Aged, Aging/*physiology, Animals, Gastrointestinal Diseases/chemically induced/etiology/*physiopathology, Gastrointestinal Motility/*physiology, Humans, Iatrogenic Disease",-1
12182689,Tolerability of hypnosedatives in older patients.,"Wortelboer U, Cohrs S, Rodenbeck A, Ruther E",Drugs Aging. 2002;19(7):529-39.,"Sleep disturbances are common and prevalence rates increase with age. Especially in the elderly, somatic diseases and medications with adverse effects relating to sleep are frequent reasons for disturbed and nonrefreshing sleep. It should be emphasised that these reasons must be excluded before symptomatic therapy is started. In some cases the use of hypnosedatives may be included as part of the treatment of a somatic disease and may cause sleep disturbances. Pharmacotherapy is one of the main approaches in the management of primary insomnia and should be part of a broader treatment strategy including nonpharmacological methods. This article focuses on the tolerability of frequently prescribed hypnosedatives in the elderly with primary insomnia and addresses the primary care physician. In general, recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of insomnia in elderly patients include using a reduced dosage. For some substances (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone, zaleplon, temazepam and triazolam) the recommended dosage is half that recommended for younger patients. The properties of the selected hypnosedative should be taken into consideration and matched with the type of sleep disturbance experienced by the patient. Ultrashort-acting drugs may be useful when initiating sleep is the main problem, whereas short- and intermediate-acting substances are recommended for maintaining sleep. Possible interactions with pre-existing medication must also be taken into consideration. Some agents such as antipsychotics, antidepressants, melatonin and herbal agents may be used in specific indications. However, only a few of these substances have proven tolerability in the elderly and further investigations are recommended.","Aged, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use, Benzodiazepines/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/drug therapy",-1

Electrical activity consisting of spontaneous continuous motor unit activity and/or electrical myokymia was documented in all patients. When electrical myokymia was observed (66%), the grouped discharges where irregular and had an interburst frequency of 2-300 Hz. Both phenytoin and carbamazepine are effective treatments. We conclude that IGM has a wide spectrum of symptoms and severity and should be considered in all patients that present with stiffness, cramps, or muscle twitching.

Ashworth scale was used for clinical evaluation of spasticity. RESULTS: Motor evoked potentials, present in two patients before baclofen, were preserved after injection. Before baclofen, H reflex was present in 5 patients (H(max)/M(max) from 0.23 to 0.84) and absent in one who had infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy. After baclofen, it was absent in 4 patients and markedly reduced in one. Surface of flexor reflex significantly decreased after baclofen (P=0.01), while threshold significantly increased (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In spastic children, the action of baclofen on spinal pathways may be quantified by the same electrophysiological procedures as in adults.

12390051,Restless legs syndrome in the older adult: diagnosis and management.,"Milligan SA, Chesson AL",Drugs Aging. 2002;19(10):741-51.,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is common in the elderly, with an estimated prevalence of 10 to 35% in individuals over 65 years of age. RLS is characterised by paraesthesias and dysaesthesias of the legs, typically occurring in the evening. The symptoms occur at rest and result in motor restlessness; movement often temporarily relieves the symptoms. Patients with poorly controlled RLS may develop related problems including insomnia (due to sleep-onset restlessness or periodic limb movements or related sleep fragmentation) and depression. RLS can be a primary disorder that develops in the young and includes familial cases. Secondary RLS occurs in association with iron-deficiency anaemia, uraemia and polyneuropathies. Typically, RLS is misdiagnosed or undiagnosed for years. In the elderly, both primary and secondary types of the disorder are common. It is thought that RLS represents lower CNS levels of, or reduced responsiveness to, dopamine. The symptoms improve with dopaminergic therapy. Ergotamine dopamine-receptor agonists such as pergolide, and the non-ergotamine dopamine-receptor agonists pramipexole and ropinirole, are becoming more commonly used to treat RLS. The dopamine precursor levodopa, in combination with carbidopa, is another effective therapeutic agent. An advantage of levodopa is lower cost than non-ergotamine and ergotamine dopamine-receptor agonists. However, the adverse effect of symptom augmentation appears to develop more frequently with levodopa than dopamine-receptor agonists; therefore, levodopa may currently be used somewhat less often as first-line therapy. Patients with painful symptoms may respond favourably to the anticonvulsants gabapentin and carbamazepine. Opioids and hypnosedatives are helpful in selected patients; however, these agents may have troubling adverse effects in the elderly. Correction of iron deficiency improves symptoms in patients with low ferritin levels. Lifestyle modification may also be helpful. Therapy is directed at symptoms, and most symptomatic patients benefit from treatment. It is important to consider RLS in the differential diagnosis of any patient with paraesthesias of the limbs.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Diagnosis, Differential, Dopamine Agonists/therapeutic use, Hematinics/therapeutic use, Humans, Iron/blood/therapeutic use, Life Style, Middle Aged, Restless Legs Syndrome/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy",-1

Such reactions may occur after short- or long-term therapy. Most patients experienced rapidly developing trismus, facial dystonia, dysarthria, and occasionally, decreases in consciousness, motor incoordination, and weakness.

In thirteen children the condition was idiopathic and nine of them had a positive family history; the remaining one had a Chiari malformation. Response to antiepileptic drugs was good in 60% of the treated patients. Six children had paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, with a mean age at onset of 8.1 years. Five children were symptomatic because of cerebral palsy (two patients), basal ganglia stroke (one patient), and acute inflammatory encephalopathy (one patient); the remaining patient's condition was familial with autosomal-dominant mode of inheritance. Response to medical treatment was unsuccessful contrasting with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. Six children had paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia, with a mean age at onset of 5 years. Their condition was idiopathic, with a positive family history in four. Two of these patients had also rolandic epilepsy and writer's cramp, and the syndrome had been previously mapped to chromosome 16. Although there have been great advances in the genetics of paroxysmal dyskinesias in which an ion channel dysfunction has been hypothesized, the diagnosis is still based on clinical grounds.

METHODS: A prospective, multicenter study was conducted in 68 patients who had been enrolled in the initial evaluation of ITB therapy and were willing to participate in long-term surveillance. Seventy-three percent of the patients were younger than 16 years of age at the time of study entry. The patients were examined at least every 3 months and were observed for an average of 70 months. At each follow-up visit, spasticity in the upper and lower extremities was evaluated by applying Ashworth scores. All adverse events and complications were recorded on standardized data forms. Spasticity in both upper and lower extremities decreased significantly (p < 0.005) and remained decreased up to 10 years. The dosage of ITB increased from a mean of 157 microg/day 3 months after pump insertion to 300 microg/day at 2 years postimplantation, and remained relatively stable thereafter. There were no significant differences in ITB dosage in children of different ages. Adverse events potentially related to ITB therapy occurred in 50% of patients within 2 months after pump insertion and in 50% of patients thereafter; hypotonia and lethargy were the two most common adverse events. The most common complications of surgery were catheter-related problems (31%), seromas (24%), and cerebrospinal fluid leaks (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal baclofen provides effective long-term treatment of spasticity of cerebral origin and its effects do not appear to diminish with time.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tizanidine, a centrally acting alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist, in the treatment of stroke-related spasticity. METHODS: Forty-seven patients, who were a minimum of 6 months poststroke and had significant spasticity, were studied at 4 centers. Tizanidine was administered in an open-label manner for 16 weeks, beginning at 2 mg/d and slowly titrated to a maximum of 36 mg/d. The Modified Ashworth Scale, muscle strength testing, functional assessments, and Pain and Functional Spasticity Questionnaires were administered at baseline and at 4, 8, 16, and 18 weeks (after 1 week off tizanidine). RESULTS: Spasticity was significantly improved between baseline and week 16, with a decrease in total upper extremity Modified Ashworth Scale score of 2.80+/-0.47 (P<0.0001). No decline in strength was noted. Treatment with tizanidine resulted in a significant improvement in pain intensity (P=0.0375), quality of life (P=0.0001), and physician assessment of disability (P=0.0001). The most frequent side effects were somnolence (62%) and dizziness (32%). No serious adverse events were considered to be drug related. Ten of 47 patients (21%) were able to reach the maximum daily dosage of 36 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data suggest that tizanidine is safe and efficacious in the treatment of stroke-related spasticity, preserving muscle strength while reducing muscle tone and painful spasms in affected patients.","Clonidine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Hand Strength, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology, Pain/drug therapy/etiology, Quality of Life, Severity of Illness Index, Stroke/*complications, Treatment Outcome",1
10952483,Hydroquinine pharmacokinetics after oral administration in adult patients with muscle cramps.,"van Kan HJ, Jansen PH, Tuinte C, Smits P, Verbeek AL",Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2000 Jun;56(3):263-7.,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the pharmacokinetic properties of hydroquinine after oral administration in adult patients with muscle cramps. The main reason for this study was the poor availability of pharmacokinetic data, hindering the design of studies to explore the possible relationship between hydroquinine concentrations and effects. METHODS: Sixteen adult patients with a clinical history of muscle cramps were given once-daily oral doses of 300 mg hydroquinine hydrobromide for 4 days. Serum and saliva samples were taken following a predefined schedule until 24 h after the last dose. Urine was collected during the study period. Hydroquinine concentrations were measured, and calculations were made of pharmacokinetic parameters using non-linear curve fitting. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetics of hydroquinine could be best described using a one-compartment open model. After oral administration, hydroquinine was rapidly absorbed (mean +/- SD: maximum concentration 2.43+/-0.68 mg/ 1; time to maximum concentration 1.4+/-1.2 h; lag time 0.54+/-0.50 h). With an elimination half-life of 10.9+/-6.1 h, steady-state was reached in several days. The distribution volume was 1.24+/-0.29 l/kg, total clearance was 6.7+/-3.2 l/h. The measured unbound hydroquinine fraction was 8.6+/-3.0%. No correlation was found between saliva and serum concentrations. Cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged hydroquinine 24 h after the first dose was 35.5+/-9.2 mg. CONCLUSION: Pharmacokinetic properties of hydroquinine are roughly similar to those of quinine. The unchanged fraction of hydroquinine excreted in urine is higher than that reported for quinine. Saliva hydroquinine concentrations could not be related to serum values. Steady-state trough or other fixed-time serum concentrations may prove useful for further optimisation of hydroquinine dosage.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Female, Humans, Hydroquinones/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy",-1
10875297,Restless legs syndrome: clinical features and treatment.,"Tan EK, Ondo W",Am J Med Sci. 2000 Jun;319(6):397-403.,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS), widely recognized as a definite clinical entity, has an estimated prevalence of 1 to 15% in different ethnic populations. However, it remains an underdiagnosed condition and its symptoms are frequently ascribed to stress and anxiety. Advancement in modern imaging techniques and clinical drug trials provide evidence of an impaired dopaminergic system in RLS. Management involves investigating and correcting treatable secondary causes, avoidance of aggravating factors, and pharmacologic therapy. Recent controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of dopamine agonists such as pramipexole and pergolide. Additional research is needed to further elucidate the pathophysiology of RLS, through obtaining post-mortem specimens and refinement of neuroimaging and neurophysiologic techniques. Isolation of specific genetic loci in familial cases would enable better characterization of distinct clinical and genetic subsets of RLS and result in better understanding of this disease at the molecular level.","Adrenergic Agonists/therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anti-Anxiety Agents/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Benzodiazepines, Diagnosis, Differential, Dopamine Agents/therapeutic use, Humans, *Restless Legs Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology/therapy",-1
10022678,Multiple sclerosis and the urologist.,"Litwiller SE, Frohman EM, Zimmern PE",J Urol. 1999 Mar;161(3):743-57.,"PURPOSE: We provide an updated reference detailing the neurological and urological state of the art approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) with special emphasis on the pathology and physiology, effects on the genitourinary tract, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment of neurological and urological manifestations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MEDLINE computerized reference search and manual bibliography review were performed to find pertinent peer reviewed articles on the neurological and urological manifestations and treatment of MS. A meta-analysis was performed on the urodynamic findings of 22 studies involving 1,882 patients from well-defined MS populations. RESULTS: The majority of patients with MS have genitourinary symptoms ranging from urgency, urge incontinence and frequency to urinary retention. Symptoms do not accurately reflect the underlying urological pathology but parallel pyramidal tract dysfunction. Urodynamic evaluation has an important role in determining proper bladder management. The most common urodynamic finding is detrusor hyperreflexia in 62% of these patients, followed by detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 25% and hypocontractility in 20%. Less than 1% of patients has renal deterioration and most may be treated with conservative measures. If conservative measures fail, new forms of bladder reconstruction and diversion may be effectively used. The incidence of sexual dysfunction is up to 80% in men and 72% in women, and treatment focuses on improvement of overall disability and erectile or orgasmic function. CONCLUSIONS: Although the genitourinary consequences of MS are rarely life threatening, they can cause significant morbidity and patient frustration. With the rapid advances in the medical management of MS the urologist should be actively involved in multispecialty treatment of these patients.","Female, Humans, Intestinal Diseases/etiology, Male, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications/diagnosis/etiology/therapy, Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological/etiology, Urodynamics, Urologic Diseases/*etiology",-1

Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit.

9579301,Increased ocular pressure in two patients with narrow angle glaucoma treated with venlafaxine.,"Aragona M, Inghilleri M",Clin Neuropharmacol. 1998 Mar-Apr;21(2):130-1.,"Venlafaxine blocks the specific monoamine transporters and is devoid of significant action on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. To our knowledge, no cases of glaucoma have been reported so far. Because pain perception involves both serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms, venlafaxine also may be useful in neuropathic pain therapy. We report on two patients with narrow angle glaucoma affected by chronic pain. When venlafaxine treatment was begun, their ocular pressure was steadily around 17-18 mmHg. Venlafaxine was chosen (daily dose 75 mg) because this drug is claimed not to bind on muscarinic cholinergic receptors. However, 4 days later the ocular pressure of the first patient increased to 22 mmHg, which led to suspension of the drug. The ocular pressure of the second patient was 18.5 mmHg after a week, 21 mmHg after 2 weeks, and 23 mmHg after 16 days. One week after suspension, ocular pressure of the patients was 17 and 18 mmHg, respectively. Possible explanations of this ocular effect are offered: pharmacokinetic interference on the drugs used in glaucoma treatment, in vivo action on the muscarinic receptor, indirect effect via dopaminergic receptors, or direct effect on the ocular sympathetic postganglionic neurones. In any case, from a clinical viewpoint, caution should be used when giving venlafaxine to patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, and ocular pressure must be monitored.","Aged, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*adverse effects, Cyclohexanols/*adverse effects, Female, Glaucoma, Angle-Closure/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Humans, Intraocular Pressure/*drug effects, Ocular Hypertension/chemically induced, Pain/drug therapy",-1
8926489,Clinical scales for multiple sclerosis.,"Sharrack B, Hughes RA",J Neurol Sci. 1996 Jan;135(1):1-9.,"Many neurological rating scales have been suggested to assess the impact of multiple sclerosis on patients, but none has been universally accepted. The Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale has been the most widely used despite its imperfections. It combines disability and impairment, has moderate inter-rater reliability, and its overall score is heavily weighted toward ambulation. The Scripps Neurological Rating Scale attempts to quantify impairment as measured by the traditional neurological examination. However, this and other impairment scales lack direct relevance to patients' functional health status. The Ambulation Index and some of the quantitative upper limb dysfunction assessment methods are sensitive and reproducible, but they only measure limited aspects of the wide range of disabilities encountered in multiple sclerosis. Current scales of disability and activities of daily living, such as the Incapacity Status Scale and the Functional Independent Measure, are not sensitive to the type of change which occurs in multiple sclerosis. The relationship between abnormalities on magnetic resonance images of the brain and disability has been difficult to ascertain. Although recently developed imaging acquisition methods may demonstrate abnormalities which are more closely correlated with disability, the demonstration of prevention, stabilization or recovery from disability using clinical scales will remain the final arbiter of success in clinical trials. We suggest guidelines for an improved disability scale.","*Disability Evaluation, Humans, Multiple Sclerosis/*diagnosis/*physiopathology, Neurologic Examination",-1

We carried out a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial of gabapentin versus no treatment in 120 patients with type II or III spinal muscular atrophy for 12 months. We assessed maximum voluntary isometric contraction with a handheld myometer and calculated an arm megascore (summing elbow flexion, hand grip, and three-point pinch scores), and a leg megascore (summing knee flexion, knee extension, and foot extension scores). Forced vital capacity and timed tasks were also evaluated. Arm megascore improved by at least 30% in 24.6% of treated and 16.9% of untreated patients (relative risk = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.71-2.97). The leg megascore improved by at least 30% in 37.7% of treated and 20.3% of untreated patients (relative risk = 1.85; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-3.37). We conclude that gabapentin produced a significant improvement in leg megascore at 6 months, which was more evident at 12 months, with a trend for improvement in arm megascore at 12 months.

METHODS: According to approval of the local ethics committee, 9 consecutive SCI patients (6 men, 3 women) had catheter and port implantation between January 1998 and May 1999. All did not respond to systemic drug therapy in combination to self-clean intermittent catheterisation (SCIC). Implantation was done under general anesthesia. Needle and catheter were Medtronic Infusion Synchromed Intraspinal catheter (Induratrade mark, 8703W). Clonidine test injections were allowed at D5. RESULTS: There were no complications during operation. Follow-up was 8.2 months (0.5-17). After clonidine bolus injection test and validation, 6 patients decided to have permanent pump implantation, 2 chose other therapies and one did not tolerate clonidine intrathecal injections for blood arterial pressure side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal clonidine may represent a useful conservative treatment of both severe bladder hyperreflexia and spinal spasticity. Its short-term effects can be individually evaluated through bolus injection in subcutaneous port before definitive pump implantation.","Adult, *Catheters, Indwelling, Clonidine/*administration & dosage, Feasibility Studies, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle, Smooth/drug effects/physiopathology, Reflex, Abnormal/drug effects, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, Spine, Sympatholytics/*administration & dosage, Urinary Bladder Diseases/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology",-1

We describe an individual with paraplegia who for many years experienced rapidly fluctuating, severe, unilateral pain below the level of his lesion. Prior to the initiation of pharmacological treatment, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured during PAIN and NON-PAIN states using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). When experiencing pain, the subject had increased anterior cingulate gyrus blood flow, increased thalamic blood flow bilaterally and increased somatosensory cortex blood flow contralaterally but decreased caudate blood flow bilaterally. The subject's subsequent clinical course included a trial of gabapentin which produced a substantial reduction in frequency and average intensity of his episodic pain and which has been maintained for almost 2 years. This case demonstrates the correspondence between rCBF and pain associated with spinal cord injury and also suggests the potential utility of gabapentin for treatment of this central pain state.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Brain/radionuclide imaging, Cerebrovascular Circulation/*physiology, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Humans, Male, Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications/radionuclide imaging, *Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of intrathecal baclofen (ITB) for upper extremity spastic hypertonia in tetraplegia of spinal origin. SETTING: University of Alabama at Birmingham hospital. METHODS: The medical records of 14 individuals with tetraplegia of spinal origin who underwent intrathecal baclofen pump placement were reviewed. The effects of intrathecal baclofen on spasm frequency, deep tendon reflexes, and tone (Ashworth scale) were assessed for the upper and lower extremities for a 1-year follow-up period. RESULTS: There were statistically significant declines in upper extremity spasm scores (1.8 points, P=0.012), reflex scores (1.4 points, P<0.0001) and Ashworth scores (0.6 points, P<0.0001) for the 1-year follow-up period.

Carbamazepine and valproic acid (sodium valproate) are effective as antimanic treatments, and the success of these medications has prompted investigation of other AEDs as possible treatments in patients with mood disorders. Lamotrigine appears to be the most promising of the newer AEDs with respect to effects in mood disorders. Current evidence suggests efficacy of this drug both as monotherapy and as an adjunctive agent in bipolar depression, and studies are underway to clarify its efficacy in mood stabilisation and rapid cycling, as currently available data are equivocal. Use of gabapentin is not as well supported in the literature, although data from open trials using it as an adjunctive agent suggest that it may be helpful in patients with bipolar depression. There have been some open trials and case reports supporting the use of topiramate as an adjunctive agent for the treatment of mania; however, data from controlled trials are not yet available.

Cerebrovascular disease is a common cause of epilepsy in the elderly. Drug treatment of the elderly is a challenge because of pharmacokinetic changes with aging, including impaired drug protein binding or displacement of drug from protein binding sites, potentially causing drug toxicity as a result of increased free drug concentrations. With aging, hepatic mass and blood flow decline along with renal function. Established anticonvulsant drugs have adverse effects and drug interactions that can make treating the elderly difficult. Newly available anticonvulsants cause fewer drug-drug interactions and less toxicity. Gabapentin is not metabolised, is not bound to protein, and has a favourable adverse effect profile and thus may be useful in the treatment of elderly patients. Lamotrigine reduced seizures between 20 and 30% in trials. Dose response was between 300mg per day and 500mg per day. This drug was well tolerated in open-label trials. Rash occurred in younger patients. Oxcarbazepine is rapidly absorbed and is converted to a monohydroxy derivative. Use with hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs necessitates an increase in dose. This drug may be substituted for carbamazepine. Hyponatraemia has been reported and monitoring is suggested. Topiramate blocks voltage-dependent sustained repetitive firing and has an effect on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. It affects glutamate responses and inhibits carbonic anhydrase. Topiramate has a dose response pattern up to 400mg per day. Cognitive effects limits its use in some patients. Nephrolithiasis has occurred with this drug. Tiagabine blocks GABA transporter proteins. Clearance is rapid and metabolism complete. Hepatic dysfunction prolongs clearance. The use of tiagabine has not been reported in the elderly. Zonisamide is rapidly absorbed and protein binding is 50%. Plasma half-life is 55 hours but is reduced to about 30 hours by hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs. Responder rate is 45%. Adverse effects include drowsiness, altered thinking and nephrolithiasis. Treatment of the elderly requires obligatory polypharmacy with potential drug interactions. Changes in body physiology alter absorption, binding, metabolism and elimination of drugs. Concomitant illness and sensitivity to drug effects narrow the therapeutic range and complicate pharmacokinetics in elderly patients. Newer anticonvulsant drugs have advantages that may outweigh risks and have therapeutic profiles that may aid in the treatment of this special population of patients.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anticonvulsants/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Digestive System/*metabolism, Drug Interactions, Epilepsy/drug therapy/*metabolism, Female, Humans, Kidney/*metabolism, Liver/*metabolism, Male",-1
7960733,A comparative study of amitriptyline and fluvoxamine in migraine prophylaxis.,Bank J,Headache. 1994 Sep;34(8):476-8.,"Current treatment of migraine either abortive or prophylactic is often unsatisfactory. Prophylactic treatment of severe migraine may reduce attack frequency, and current therapy centers on beta-blockers, serotonin (5-HT) reuptake blockers and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. The author compared the efficacy and safety of amitriptyline and fluvoxamine among migraine patients (24F, 8M vs. 23F, 9M) in a double blind study. The efficacy of amitriptyline has already been established by earlier clinical studies. The other investigated drug, fluvoxamine, has a more selective 5-HT reuptake blocking property than amitriptyline. In this study, amitriptyline significantly reduced the number of headache attacks, but it caused severe drowsiness in many migraineurs. The fluvoxamine also favorably influenced on the number of headache attacks and caused only slight side effects. These findings suggest, that fluvoxamine may be an alternative drug in migraine prophylaxis, however, further studies should be performed with more subjects.","Adult, Amitriptyline/*therapeutic use, Female, Fluvoxamine/*therapeutic use, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/*prevention & control",-1

Treatment goals need to be well defined and tailored to the individual patient's needs. Growth and development is a continuous and evolving process, necessitating the constant reassessment of the patient and modification of future treatment goals.

The author reports a patient with a posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma (schwannoma). For a decade, the tumor was misdiagnosed as nonspecific S1 radiculopathy and psychogenic chronic pain syndrome. The patient's presentation and initial management are unique. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old woman reported severe left foot and calf pain, numbness, and weakness. The symptoms were evident during three pregnancies, and they gradually progressed. The neuropathic pain was protracted, despite implantation of a dorsal column stimulator and administration of a wide variety of medications and therapies. The symptoms were unresponsive to both inpatient and outpatient treatments, which resulted in a misdiagnosis of psychogenic pain for more than a decade. Diagnostic scans obtained by computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear scintigraphy confirmed a popliteal fossa mass. INTERVENTION: A high, large posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma was found intraoperatively, positioned just below the sciatic nerve bifurcation with extensive degenerative features and hemorrhages. Surgical resection provided immediate recovery. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve tumors are rarely acknowledged clinical entities. Chronic unexplained foot and calf pain and a positive Tinel's sign should raise suspicion of posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma. Even in patients who have had such tumors for a decade, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice.","Adult, Female, Humans, Neurilemmoma/*diagnosis, Peripheral Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis, *Tibial Nerve, Time Factors",-1
7726426,"Analgesic and hemodynamic effects of epidural clonidine, clonidine/morphine, and morphine after pancreatic surgery--a double-blind study.","Rockemann MG, Seeling W, Brinkmann A, Goertz AW, Hauber N, Junge J, Georgieff M",Anesth Analg. 1995 May;80(5):869-74.,"This study characterizes analgesia an hemodynamics after epidural clonidine 8 micrograms/kg (Group C) or clonidine 4 micrograms/kg+morphine 2 mg (Group CM) in comparison to epidural morphine 50 micrograms/kg (Group M). Forty-five patients scheduled for pancreatectomy in combined general/epidural anesthesia were studied. The study drugs were administered 75 min postoperatively and for 10 h pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and cardiac output (CO) were measured; filling pressures were kept > 5 mm Hg. Adequate analgesia could be achieved within 1 h in all patients of Groups C and CM, but only in six patients of Group M (P < 0.001). Quality of analgesia was comparable in all groups (VAS reduction 82% +/- 20%, mean +/- SD) but duration of analgesic action was longer in Groups CM (586 +/- 217 min) and M (775 +/- 378 min) compared to Group C (336 +/- 119 min) (P < 0.001). In Group M, no hemodynamic alterations occurred. In Groups C and CM, HR, CO, and MAP were reduced significantly compared to baseline within the first 15-90 min, while stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance remained stable. We conclude, that hemodynamic alteration after epidural clonidine under conditions of stable filling pressures is caused mainly by a decrease in HR. It is not an effect of analgesia but of the intrinsic antihypertensive action of clonidine.","*Analgesia, Epidural, *Clonidine/administration & dosage/pharmacology, Double-Blind Method, Female, Hemodynamics/*drug effects, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, *Morphine/administration & dosage/pharmacology, Pain Measurement, Pain, Postoperative/*therapy, *Pancreatectomy, Prospective Studies",-1

Gabapentin is a newer generation antiepileptic drug that is commonly used in treatment of neuropathic pain. An evaluation of clinical trials using gabapentin to treat neuropathic pain was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin appears to be effective in treating various neuropathic pain disorders. Gabapentin may have advantages over current therapies, such as a favorable safety profile and lack of drug interactions; however, cost issues and limited experience may limit the use of gabapentin as a first-line option.","Acetates/economics/*therapeutic use, *Amines, Analgesics/economics/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Humans, Neuralgia/*drug therapy/etiology, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Apart from the spinal symptoms, other neurological signs of brain involvement are usually found and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals disseminated foci in the brain. The positive evoked responses, the immunological abnormalities of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and the oligoclonality together prove the presence of multiple sclerosis. In these cases the symptoms of transverse myelitis can separately precede other signs of multiple sclerosis, or appear as a relapse. Recurrent transverse myelitis as an independent entity, with negative MRI and CSF immunology, is an exciting topic in terms of the etiological factors and therapeutic considerations. The view in the literature is that the occurrence of transverse myelitis as an independent entity is rather rare. The present article reports the case of a female patient with recurrent spinal cord signs, and negative MRI and CSF immunology. During a ten-year follow-up observation period, symptoms of multiple sclerosis did not develop. Further studies of such cases are needed in order to clarify the etiological factors, the pathomechanism and the therapeutic considerations relating to this relatively new and probably independent clinical entity.","Adult, Brain/physiology, Diagnosis, Differential, Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory, Evoked Potentials, Visual, Fatal Outcome, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Multiple Sclerosis/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis, Myelitis, Transverse/cerebrospinal fluid/*diagnosis/physiopathology, Recurrence, Spinal Cord/physiopathology",-1

A placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-dose study in healthy volunteers.","Steinhoff BJ, Freudenthaler N, Paulus W",Epilepsy Res. 1997 Dec;29(1):35-47.,"The influence of single oral dosages of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproic acid, vigabatrin (VGB), lamotrigine (LTG), gabapentin (GBP), and losigamone (LSG) on visual perception was investigated in ten healthy volunteers according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. The test battery comprised visual acuity, the Lanthony-D-15-desature colour perception test, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia threshold measurements, perception threshold assessment for monochromatic and chromatic gaussian dots, monochromatic gratings and gratings of differing spatial frequency, and critical flicker fusion tests with various stimuli. The only consistent and partly significant effects were seen after VGB and GBP. After VGB, increment, postadaptation and transient tritanopia thresholds and the critical flicker fusion increased, whereas GBP led to a somewhat converse profile. The other tests were not influenced consistently by any antiepileptic drug (AED). We conclude that: (i) gamma-amino-butyric acid-(GABA)-related properties as under the prototype drug VGB result in specific alterations of the transient tritanopia phenomenon which is consistent with the physiological hypothesis for this retinal paradigm based on extracellular recordings in primates. The possible mechanisms why VGB improved critical flicker fusion as the only AED in this trial are discussed. The profile of GBP indicates a unique mechanism of action. We have not observed specific influences on visual perception under AEDs which act mainly via alterations of ion membrane conductance. The transient tritanopia and flicker fusion paradigms we used appear to be promising to investigate antiepileptic drugs with hitherto unknown modes of actions in human noninvasively.","Adaptation, Ocular, Administration, Oral, Adult, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Color Perception/drug effects, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Female, Flicker Fusion, Humans, Male, Psychometrics, Psychophysics, Reference Values, Sensory Thresholds, Visual Perception/*drug effects",-1

12800479,Management of neuropathy and foot problems in diabetic patients.,Vinik AI,Clin Cornerstone. 2003;5(2):38-55.,"Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a complex set of clinical syndromes that affect distinct regions of the nervous system, either singly or combined. DN is the most common form of neuropathy in the developed countries of the world and is responsible for 50% to 75% of nontraumatic amputations. It is also the most life damaging--once autonomic neuropathy sets in, the mortality rate approximates 25% to 50% within 5 to 10 years. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy, the most common form of DN, usually involves both small and large nerve fiber damage. Small nerve fiber neuropathies occur early and are often present without objective signs or electrophysiologic evidence of nerve damage. The greatest risk is foot ulceration and subsequent gangrene. Large nerve fiber neuropathies, which involve the sensory and motor nerves, are generally neuropathies of signs rather than symptoms. Clinical presentation usually includes a ""glove and stocking"" distribution of sensory loss and the greatest risk is Charcot's neuroarthropathy. Diagnosis of DN relies heavily on a careful patient history and physical examination. Most critical is that both the patient and the patient's shoes should be examined and corrective measures taken. Several studies have shown that good diabetes control can significantly reduce neuropathy. As new drugs and ways to enhance nerve blood flow and block pain pathways at different levels are being explored, the effective treatment of DN and the reduction of its impact on quality of life as well as mortality will become a reality. Patient education and preventive strategies, however, are still the best ways to treat the complications of neuropathy and reduce the amputation rate.","Amputation, Capsaicin/therapeutic use, Diabetic Foot/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy, Diabetic Neuropathies/*diagnosis/physiopathology/*therapy, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Hyperglycemia/therapy, Nerve Compression Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology/therapy, Risk Assessment, Risk Factors",-1

Currently, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the ""first choice"" agents for pharmacologic treatment of OCD, although few head-to-head comparisons exist between any two specific agents. Strategies for nonresponders and partial responders to the SRI/SSRIs are reviewed. The only agents that have shown significant improvement as augmenting agents to an SRI/SSRI in systematic trials have been clonazepam and haloperidol. Predictors of response to pharmacotherapy have been limited, but several reports have found that an early age at onset of OCD has been associated with a poorer response to medications. Long-term maintenance medication may be necessary for some, although behavioral therapy may improve the need for extended pharmacotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy, specifically exposure with response prevention, still remains an effective and important component of treatment for many. One of the newest developments is the identification of a pediatric subtype of OCD characterized by prepubertal acute onset after group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. Investigation trials with these children include immunomodulatory therapies and penicillin treatment and prophylaxis. If a unique subgroup of children with OCD can be identified, then novel treatments may prove effective and have a role in long-term prophylaxis.","Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Age Factors, Age of Onset, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/therapeutic use, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Clomipramine/therapeutic use, Clonazepam/therapeutic use, Cognitive Therapy, Haloperidol/therapeutic use, Humans, Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control/therapy, Penicillins/therapeutic use, Plasmapheresis, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

Data from research trials as well as clinical experience are accumulating to indicate that the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)--fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline--and perhaps venlafaxine, which inhibits both serotonergic and noradrenergic reuptake, are useful antipanic medications.

It was developed in reaction to the large number of unsatisfied postoperative patients suffering from moderate to severe pain despite the availability of potent analgesic drugs. With PCA, patients are allowed to self-administer small analgesic doses into a running intravenous infusion, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or even into the spinal space. Clinical experience soon demonstrated that individual variability in pain intensity and analgesic needs was extremely large. Psychological factors seem to be as important as the surgical trauma. Opioid consumption is usually higher than with conventional regimens, but without serious side effects. Although patients generally prefer self-control, pain relief is not necessarily better than with well-conducted conventional techniques. In addition to routine clinical pain management, PCA has proven its importance in research, e.g. for pain measurement, to determine predictors of postoperative pain, to evaluate drug interactions and the concept of pre-emptive analgesia, or for pharmacokinetic designs. PCA has been extremely important in order to change the mind of physicians and nursing staff with respect to individual pain management strategies.","*Analgesia, Patient-Controlled, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Humans, Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy",-1

Thirty-five children with spastic CP were evaluated. The injection group consisted of 25 patients who were injected with btA and received conventional physical therapy. The control group consisted of 10 patients who were treated with conventional physical therapy only. In the injection group, btA was applied to the lower extremity spastic muscles at a total dose of 8-10 lU/kg. Spasticity was measured by the Ashworth scale. Gait function was evaluated by clinical gait assessment in all patients and temporal distance factors in 16 patients. All the parameters were recorded before treatment, after three days and after one month of therapy. Following injection of btA, significant improvement in all parameters was observed. No statistically significant progression was noted in the control group except clinical gait analysis scores. Comparing the three-day and one-month measurements of spasticity of the two groups, statistically significant results were obtained in favour of the injection group in all parameters except for clinical gait analysis scores. The findings of this study showed btA injection to be an effective treatment for reducing spasticity and improving gait function in patients with spastic CP","Adolescent, Botulinum Toxins, Type A/*administration & dosage, Cerebral Palsy/complications, Child, Female, Gait/drug effects, Humans, Injections, Intramuscular, Lower Extremity, Male, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology/rehabilitation, Neuromuscular Agents/*administration & dosage, Statistics, Nonparametric, Treatment Outcome",-1

We describe a patient who developed a unilateral hand tremor mimicking primary writing tremor after discrete cerebral cortical infarction. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old man developed mild right hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a discrete cortical infarct in the left frontal area. After recovery of motor power, the patient showed significant right hand tremor exclusively during writing or similar motor activities including tooth brushing or shaving. The tremor was temporarily alleviated by clonazepam but persisted until 7 months of follow-up. Medical history suggested that the patient had mild essential tremor, but he did not experience tremor on writing before the onset of stroke. CONCLUSIONS: This observation suggests that unilateral hand tremor mimicking primary writing tremor may be produced by cortical infarction. It remains unclear whether the patient's previous essential tremor played an additional role in the development of this symptom.","Aged, Cerebral Infarction/*complications/diagnosis, *Handwriting, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Tremor/*etiology",-1

A previous report has documented that intra-abdominal positioning of the intrathecal pump may predispose the pump-catheter neck to premature catheter breakdown and leakage. Based on this report, we reviewed over 100 intrathecal pump cases to determine the frequency of malpositioning and its role in the pathogenesis of catheter failure. We found three specific cases where a 'fulcrum effect' occurred due to intra-abdominal positioning of the pump predisposing the catheter to breakdown. This study demonstrates that intra-abdominal placement of the pump can predispose the catheter to failure/breakdown and that surgeons should attempt to place the pump catheter neck in a superiomedial position, distant from any bony prominences, to prevent the 'fulcrum effect' on the pump-catheter neck junction and reducing the likelihood of either internal or external compressive forces.","Analgesia, Epidural/*instrumentation, Baclofen/*administration & dosage, *Catheters, Indwelling, Cerebral Palsy/*drug therapy/radiography, Child, Device Removal, *Equipment Failure Analysis, Humans, Ilium/radiography, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal/*instrumentation, Morphine/*administration & dosage, Pain/*drug therapy, Reoperation, Retrospective Studies, Ribs/radiography",-1

In this report, we summarize the clinical course of a 9-year-old boy with quadriplegic cerebral palsy with mixed tonal abnormalities (spasticity and dystonia) experiencing withdrawal from intrathecal baclofen. His clinical course is compared to that of adults experiencing withdrawal from IBI and to neuroleptic malignant syndrome. If unrecognized, this disorder may have significant potential for morbidity and mortality. Clues to diagnosis, appropriate evaluation, and potential treatments are discussed. When a child treated with IBI presents with unexplained multiorgan system dysfunction, particularly if accompanied by evidence of rhabdomyolysis, the integrity of the IBI system must be evaluated. In some cases, evaluation might necessitate surgical exploration. Caregivers most commonly seek urgent evaluation and treatment from their primary care provider when their child experiences fever or acute illness. Primary care providers of children treated with IBI should be made aware of this clinical scenario to prevent delays in diagnosis.","Baclofen/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology, Cerebral Palsy/*drug therapy, Child, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/pharmacology, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome/*diagnosis, Quadriplegia/drug therapy, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome",-1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five residents of three retirement communities (86% women; mean age, 82.0 years) were assigned randomly to a 7-week pain self-management group or an educational booklet control condition. Participants completed self-report measures of pain, functioning, depression, and pain-related beliefs at baseline, 9 weeks later (after treatment), and 3 months after the post-treatment assessment. RESULTS: The self-management group showed significantly greater pre- to post-treatment improvement in physical role function (P = 0.04) and characteristic pain intensity (P = 0.02). No significant differences were found between groups on measures of pain-related activity interference, depression, and pain-related beliefs. Improvement in characteristic pain and physical role function was not associated with baseline depression scores, pretreatment expectations, or changes in pain-related beliefs. DISCUSSION: This study provides preliminary support for the efficacy of a self-management group intervention for older adults with chronic pain and has implications for future studies of such approaches for this and similar populations.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over/*psychology, Attitude to Health, Chronic Disease, Cognitive Therapy/methods, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Health Services for the Aged, Humans, Male, Pain/diagnosis/*psychology, *Pain Management, Pain Measurement/methods, Patient Education as Topic, Psychotherapy, Group/*methods, Self Care/*methods/psychology, Self Efficacy, Treatment Outcome",-1

Gabapentin therapy proved to be very satisfactory in relieving muscular cramps with a relatively low dosage (600 mg/day) and without any remarkable side effects. The possible interpretation of the mechanism involved in gabapentin induced relief of cramps is discussed.

9067123,A risk-benefit assessment of buspirone in the treatment of anxiety disorders.,Pecknold JC,Drug Saf. 1997 Feb;16(2):118-32.,"Anxiety disorders include generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and social phobia. Consideration of the chronicity of these disorders reveals that anxiety disorders first occur during early adolescence or young adulthood, and can wax and wane over periods of 5 to 10 years. Thus, in considering treatment, the emphasis must be placed on long term, rather than short term, management. Comorbidity studies reveal that untreated patients with anxiety disorders are at risk of social and psychological consequences, as well as disability resulting from comorbid and secondary disorders. Comparisons between buspirone and the benzodiazepines in treating patients with generalised anxiety disorder reveal that long term use of benzodiazepines is associated with adverse effects, particularly in elderly patients. Buspirone appears to have an onset of action equivalent to that of the benzodiazepines, to be well tolerated in the long term, to lack problems of habituation and withdrawal, and to be useful in patients with masked comorbid depression. In patients with panic disorder and social phobia, buspirone has not been clearly shown to be effective in comparison with the reference standards; in those patients with OCD, there are only preliminary indications of efficacy, which merit a more adjunctive role.","Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy/epidemiology, Benzodiazepines, Buspirone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Humans, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome, Substance-Related Disorders",-1

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted from 1966 to February 2003 using key phrases Malarone, atovaquone, proguanil, and malaria. Further articles were identified from a manual search of the references of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English-language studies with animal and human data evaluating preclinical pharmacology, human studies on pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials were evaluated. Relevant data were extracted from identified articles. DATA SYNTHESIS: Atovaquone-proguanil has been evaluated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum in 8 clinical trials. In these studies, treatment with atovaquone-proguanil led to a higher (87-100% vs. 72-88%) or equally effective (94-100% vs. 90-100%) cure rate than the comparator antimalarial agents. Atovaquone-proguanil has been evaluated for prophylaxis of malaria in 6 clinical trials. In the 4 placebo-controlled trials for semi-immune residents or nonimmune migrants, the prophylaxis success rates in the atovaquone-proguanil and placebo arms ranged from 98% to 100% and 48% to 82%, respectively. The prophylaxis with success rates were similar among the 2 arms when atovaquone-proguanil was compared with other antimalarial regimens in nonimmune travelers. Atovaquone-proguanil was well tolerated in these clinical trials.

Severe emesis remains one of the main extramedullary side-effects of high-dose regimens during the first week of treatment. Traditional antiemetics such as chlorpromazine, diazepam, and phenothiazines are extensively used but are unable to control emesis. The new antiemetic ondansetron, a serotonin receptor (5HT3) antagonist appears to be superior to these drugs for cisplatin-induced emesis. The study we present here is an attempt to control emesis following high-dose regimens, during bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation, with ondansetron. To our knowledge no other paper has reported the efficacy of this antiemetic in such group of patients. A total of 29 patients who received highly emetogenic polychemotherapy as conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation were treated with ondansetron, which was given as an 8-mg i.v. short infusion prior the initiation of treatment and every 6 h thereafter for 3 days, and an 8-mg dose every 8 h for 5 additional days.

We therefore undertook a double-blind study to assess whether trazodone and valproate, as compared to placebo, would attenuate withdrawal and facilitate discontinuation in BZ-dependent patients with a minimum of 1 year daily BZ use. Seventy-eight patients, taking a mean dose of 19+/-17 mg/day of diazepam (or its equivalent), were stabilized for several weeks on their BZ (16 diazepam, 25 lorazepam, 37 alprazolam) and then for 1-2 weeks, pretreated with trazodone, sodium valproate or placebo before being tapered at 25% per week. All treatments were continued for 5 weeks post-taper. BZ-free status was assessed after 5 and 12 weeks post-taper. Neither trazodone nor valproate had any significant effect on withdrawal severity.

12151115,Do preclinical seizure models preselect certain adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs.,Meldrum B,Epilepsy Res. 2002 Jun;50(1-2):33-40.,"Classical screening tests (maximal electroshock, MES, and threshold pentylenetetrazol, PTZ) employ non-epileptic rodents and identify antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) with mechanisms of action associated with significant CNS side effects. Thus MES identifies drugs acting on Na+ channels that produce cerebellar toxicity. It may be possible to produce novel AEDs more selectively targeted at voltage-sensitive (VS) ion channels. There is little specific evidence for the likely success of this strategy with subunit selective agents targeted at the different VS Na+ channels. Drugs targeted at specific VS Ca++ channels (T, N, P/Q types) may be useful in generalised seizures. There are many as yet unexplored possibilities relating to K+ channels. GABA related drugs acting on PTZ clonic seizures tend to induce sedation and muscle hypotonia. Studies in mice, particularly with knock-in mutations, but also with subunit selective agents acting via the GABA(A) benzodiazepine site, suggest that it is possible to produce agents which do or do not induce particular side effects (sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, amnesia, anaesthesia). Whether these findings transfer to man has yet to be established. Acquired epilepsy in rodents (e.g. kindling or spontaneous seizures following chemically- or electrically-induced status epilepticus) or acquired epilepsy in man (following prolonged febrile seizures or traumatic brain injury) is associated with multiple changes in the function and subunit composition of ion channels and receptor molecules. Optimal screening of novel AEDs, both for efficacy and side effects, requires models with receptor and ion channel changes similar to those in the target human syndrome.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/*pharmacology, Convulsants/pharmacology, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Electroshock, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/genetics/psychology, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/adverse effects/pharmacology, Humans, Pentylenetetrazole/pharmacology, Receptors, GABA-A/drug effects, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors, Seizures/chemically induced/genetics/*physiopathology/prevention & control, Sodium Channels/drug effects/genetics",-1

In this paper we provide an update on recent developments in the treatment of PHN. We emphasise the results of recent studies that provide an evidence-based approach for treating PHN that was not available until very recently. In randomised, controlled clinical trials, the topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin, and controlled release oxycodone have been shown to provide superior pain relief in patients with PHN when compared with placebo. It has also recently been demonstrated that the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline provides equivalent analgesic benefit when compared with amitriptyline, but is better tolerated. Based on these results, nortriptyline can now be considered the preferred antidepressant for the treatment of PHN, although desipramine may be used if the patient experiences unacceptable sedation from nortriptyline. The topical lidocaine patch, gabapentin and controlled release oxycodone all appear to be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants in the treatment of patients with PHN, and the results of these recent studies suggest that each of these treatments should be considered early in the course of treatment. Additional controlled trials are needed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of these 4 treatments- tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, the topical lidocaine patch and controlled release opioid analgesics--used singly and in various combinations in the treatment of patients with PHN.","Herpes Zoster/*complications, Humans, Neuralgia/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control/*therapy, Pain/etiology",-1

Acute pain is well understood and can be controlled with currently available analgesics. Chronic pain, however, is not effectively controlled with current analgesics and side effect profiles often limit the use of these agents. Currently there are: (i) no objective methods for defining pain or analgesia in humans; (ii) no objective methods for correlating efficacy of analgesics in animal testing with human testing; and (iii) no objective method of evaluating the efficacy of analgesics in painful conditions, including neuropathic pain in which adaptive or maladaptive changes evolve with time. A technological revolution in functional brain imaging in humans and animals offers new approaches to objective evaluation of analgesics and of clinical pain states. These approaches hold great promise for revolutionizing drug development at preclinical and clinical stages.","Analgesics/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Animals, Brain/drug effects/metabolism, Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/statistics & numerical data, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging/*methods, Technology, Pharmaceutical/*methods",-1
11207874,Pain management in older adults: prevention and treatment.,Gloth FM 3rd,J Am Geriatr Soc. 2001 Feb;49(2):188-99.,"The release of guidelines in 1998 by the American Geriatrics Society on ""The Management of Chronic Pain in Older Persons"" was a breakthrough in helping to manage pain in this population. Already advances have fostered a need to update recommendations. This article focuses on the treatment strategies available for seniors that are likely to help to fulfill the obligation to relieve pain and suffering in patients. A review was done of the literature using Medline and other search techniques. New pain scales have been developed with seniors in mind and greater testing of older scales in elderly populations have helped to identify measures of pain more suited to frail seniors. Advances in cyclooxygenase inhibition selectivity, alternative medicine, and progress in the identification of nonopioid pain receptors and the development of products to target them are just a few of changes that have altered the way clinicians think about treating pain. The use of hospice in end-of-life palliative care is a valuable resource for clinicians managing pain at that phase in care as well. Tools are available to prevent and treat pain successfully in seniors. Educating clinicians about available assessment tools, techniques and interventions may be the biggest challenge to comforting the older adult in pain.","Activities of Daily Living, *Aged, Algorithms, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Complementary Therapies/methods, Decision Trees, Geriatric Assessment, Hospice Care/methods, Humans, Pain/diagnosis, *Pain Management, Pain Measurement, Palliative Care/methods, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Receptors, Opioid",-1

Within the framework of a prospective study, evaluating the efficacy of continuous intrathecal Baclofen therapy (CIBT) on hypertonia during the initial recovery phase of severe head injury, the authors report on the preliminary results of this treatment on paroxysmal dysautonomia about four patients. Continuous intrathecal Baclofen infusion was first delivered, for a test period, continuously for 6 days. If a relapse of dysautonomia occurred at the end of the test period, an implantation of a continuous intrathecal infusion pump delivering Baclofen was performed. Results were assessed with four continuous variables; duration (days), dose of Baclofen per day (microg/d), number of dysautonomic paroxysmal episodes per day, and initial recovery evaluated by a scale of the first initial stages of head injury coma recovery. For three patients: (1) the number of dysautonomic paroxysmal episodes per day and the doses of Baclofen during the follow-up period were correlated (p = 0.02, p < 0.001, p = 0.008, respectively, distribution-free test of Spearman), (2) during the test period and the relapse after the test period, the number of paroxysmal episodes and the Baclofen dose are correlated to p < 0.05, p = 0.03, p = 0.04, respectively (distribution-free test of Spearman). The second statistical test was used to prove that Baclofen doses and number of paroxysmal dysautonomic episodes are correlated independently of the duration of follow-up. The fourth patient improved with CIBT without any recurrence at the end of the treatment test period. For the four patients, recovery score increased during the overall follow-up. In the authors' experience CIBT is very efficient to control paroxysmal dysautonomia during the initial recovery phase in severe head injury, and seems to facilitate recovery.","Acute Disease, Adolescent, Adult, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Brain Injuries/*complications/*physiopathology, GABA Agonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Glasgow Coma Scale, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Remission Induction",-1

Epileptic colony patients had an earlier age at onset of seizures, while epileptic colony and epileptic psychosis patients had more frequent seizures. Epileptic individuals in the community died at a younger age than did epileptic patients in long-stay hospital care. Psychotic epileptic patients had larger cerebral ventricles, excess periventricular gliosis, and more focal cerebral damage compared with epileptic patients who had no psychotic illness. Epileptic patients with schizophrenia-like psychosis were distinguished from all other groups by a significant excess of pinpoint perivascular white-matter softenings. We found that mesial temporal sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy occurred with equal frequency in the psychotic and nonpsychotic groups; generalized seizures occurred more frequently in the psychotic epileptics and the epileptic colony epileptics than in the community epileptic controls.","Aged, Brain/pathology/physiopathology, Electroencephalography, Epilepsy/*complications/*pathology/physiopathology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychotic Disorders/*complications/*pathology/physiopathology, Schizophrenia/*complications/*pathology/physiopathology",1

The proposed mechanism of action is the induction of GA-specific T cells characterized by protective anti-inflammatory Th2 response. We tested this hypothesis in 11 MS patients treated with GA from 1-19 months. Interferon-gamma and IL-5 (markers of Th1 and Th2 responses respectively) were assayed by ELISA in GA-specific T-cell lines (TCL) supernatants. Th1/Th2 bias was defined based on the ratio of IFN-gamma/IL-5 secretion. Fifty-eight pre-treatment and 75 on-treatment GA-specific TCL were generated. On-treatment mean IL-5 levels in GA-TCL increased significantly, whereas those for IFN-gamma were markedly reduced. Consequently, the ratio of IFN-gamma IL-5 also shifted in favor of a Th2 response. The percentage of GA-TCL classified as Th1 was decreased, whereas those classified as Th2 increased on-treatment as compared to pre-treatment. Some GA-specific TCL, (approximately 25%) generated during treatment secreted predominantly IL-5 in response to MBP and the immunodominant MBP peptide 83-99, indicating that these crossreactive antigens can act as partial agonists for GA-reactive TCL. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of action of GA in MS involves the induction of crossreactive GA-specific T cells with a predominant Th2 cytokine profile.","Cell Line, Cross Reactions, Cytokines/biosynthesis, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Interleukin-5/biosynthesis, Multiple Sclerosis/*drug therapy/*immunology, Myelin Basic Protein/*immunology, Peptides/*pharmacology, Regression Analysis, T-Lymphocytes/immunology, Th2 Cells/drug effects/*immunology",-1

Although it is not possible to offer a unified approach to neurologic patients, the primary care consultant should understand the clinical issues that are common to these patients, and the individual considerations necessitated by the nature of the neurologic disorder and the clinical characteristics of the patient. The preoperative evaluation combines elements of literature evidence on risk assessment with a thorough understanding of the planned procedure and local practice patterns, and clinical judgment as to the estimated risk-benefit ratio. Perioperative management necessitates attention to many general principles of perioperative care, such as awareness of the potential for cardiopulmonary complications and the need for DVT prophylaxis. In addition, there are management issues for neurologic patients, such as blood pressure control and evaluation of hyponatremia, which may differ from other surgical patients.

Unlike acute pain, which is protective, neuropathic pain persists and serves no useful purpose, and severely affects quality of life. However, present therapies have modest efficacy in most patients, are palliative rather than curative, and their side effects represent significant limitations. Tremendous progress has been made over the past decade in our understanding of the biology of pain sensory neurons. The recent discovery that neurotrophic factors play an important role in neuropathic pain indicates that these pathways could serve as novel intervention points for therapy.

Extending the Q-TWiST method.,"Schwartz CE, Cole BF, Gelber RD",Arch Neurol. 1995 Aug;52(8):754-62.,"BACKGROUND: Current clinical research and outcomes assessment on multiple sclerosis rely on an approach to disability measurement that is heavily influenced by ambulation. Not only is this strategy often insensitive to the clinical changes affected by pharmacotherapeutic or rehabilitative interventions but it also disregards the symptoms that patients seem to consider most enervating. We propose a new method for evaluating clinical interventions in terms of their impact on the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, side effects, parameters of exacerbation, and disease progression, while considering the patient's perspective. METHODS: The extended Q-TWiST method yields an estimation of treatment trade-offs in terms of Quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms and Toxicities (Q-TWiST). An illustration of this method is presented by using a hypothetical clinical trial of two treatments. The trade-offs between the two treatments are highlighted to facilitate treatment decision making by using individual patient importance weights.

METHODS: Documentation of visits by patients with headache to an urgent care department staffed by primary care physicians was reviewed. Patients were also sent a brief headache screen, and those who replied were interviewed by telephone. ""Repeaters"" (patients who made 3 or more visits in 6 months) were excluded from chart review. RESULTS: Over 6 months, 518 patients made 1004 visits to the emergency department for primary headache complaints: 464 patients (90%) made 1 or 2 visits (total visits, 502). A review of 174 charts documenting a diagnosis of migraine found that (1) the need for prophylaxis was determined in only 40 (31%) of the patients who were not already undergoing prophylaxis and (2) treatment in the emergency department was migraine specific in 46 patients (26%) or otherwise appropriate in 45 (25%). A review of 90 charts documenting nonmigraine diagnoses found that 30 patients (33%) had adequate history documented to exclude migraine as the diagnosis. Eighty-six patients (17%) were interviewed. An emergency department diagnosis of migraine (n = 59) corresponded to a final diagnosis of migraine with (n = 21) or without (n = 18) medication overuse or chronic daily headache and/or transformed migraine with (n = 18) or without (n = 2) medication overuse. Discharge diagnoses that were not migraine (n = 27) had final diagnoses of migraine with (n = 9) or without (n = 9) medication overuse or chronic daily headache/transformed migraine with (n = 7) or without (n = 2) medication overuse. CONCLUSIONS: In this emergency department population, many patients with migraine, chronic daily headache, or medication overuse are not accurately diagnosed.

12390045,The assessment and management of chronic pain in children.,"Chambliss CR, Heggen J, Copelan DN, Pettignano R",Paediatr Drugs. 2002;4(11):737-46.,"Chronic pain in children and adolescents is frequently misdiagnosed by caregivers. It is not treated until it results in the loss of routine ability and function. Chronic pain is often associated with underlying diseases commonly seen in childhood, including sickle cell disease, malignancy, rheumatologic disorders, inflammatory bowel disease, trauma, and states where there is no identifiable etiology. Chronic pain differs from acute pain in that it serves no useful function. Untreated or under-treated chronic pain will result in the unnecessary suffering of the patient, disruption of family routine, and cohesiveness and restriction of the child's daily activities, thereby increasing long-term disability. Accurate and repeated assessment of chronic pain is required for therapy to be effective. Assessment of chronic pain in children is difficult due to their developing cognitive abilities. The assessment of childhood pain varies with the child's age, type of pain, situation, and prior painful experiences. Assessment tools such as the Varni-Thompson Pediatric Pain Questionnaire and the Visual Analog Scale are helpful for both the patient and physician in helping to identify situations that precipitate pain, to rate the level of pain and determine if therapy has been effective. Documentation of pain assessments and the effectiveness of interventions in the medical record should be included as a routine part of all patient records. Most caregivers have extensive experience in the treatment of acute pain in children but are often not comfortable with the management of complicated and chronic pain states. The therapy for chronic pain in children is multifactorial. It can include agents from multiple classes of pharmacologic agents (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and antineuroleptics) nonconventional therapies (acupuncture and pressure and aromatherapy), as well as herbal and homeopathic remedies.","Acute Disease, Adolescent, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Chemotherapy, Adjuvant, Child, Chronic Disease, Complementary Therapies, Depression/drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Narcotics/therapeutic use, Pain/complications/*drug therapy, *Pain Measurement",-1

With regard to efficacy, 31% of the patients receiving gabapentin had a greater than 50% reduction in seizures compared with lamotrigine (25%), topiramate (20%), vigabatrin (19%) and tiagabine (11%). The number of patients remaining seizure free with gabapentin was 8% whilst for lamotrigine this was 5%, vigabatrin 5%, topiramate 1% and tiagabine 4%. In conclusion, all these five antiepileptic drugs are useful in treating refractory localization related epilepsy.","Acetates/therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Resistance, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, Female, Fructose/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nipecotic Acids/therapeutic use, Patient Dropouts, Retrospective Studies, Treatment Outcome, Triazines/therapeutic use, Vigabatrin/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
12454558,Effectiveness of adjunctive gabapentin in resistant bipolar disorder: is it due to anxious-alcohol abuse comorbidity?,"Perugi G, Toni C, Frare F, Ruffolo G, Moretti L, Torti C, Akiskal HS",J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2002 Dec;22(6):584-91.,"We evaluated effectiveness and predictors of response of gabapentin (GBP) as adjunctive treatment in a sample of 43 subjects with DSM-III-R bipolar disorder who were resistant to standard mood stabilizers. Diagnostic evaluation was performed by means of the Semistructured Interview for Mood Disorder. Clinical evaluation was performed at the beginning and end of the observation period by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Young Mania Rating Scale, and the Clinical Global Impression Scale. GBP was administered as an adjunctive treatment for an 8-week period in combination with other mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and neuroleptics. Mean dosage +/- SD at week 8 was 1270 +/- 561.4 mg (range, 600-2400 mg). Adjunctive treatment with GBP was well tolerated by almost all the subjects; only three patients had to interrupt treatment before week 8, two because of inefficacy and one because of the appearance of side effects (ataxia and irritability); in other patients, the most frequent side effects were sedation, irritability, tremor, ataxia or motor instability, and nausea. Eighteen (41.9%) of 43 patients who began treatment were considered responders. Mean total HAM-D score showed a significant reduction during the 8 weeks of treatment. Analysis of the various HAM-D dimensions showed that the anxiety-somatization factor was the one with the greatest change. Seventeen of the 18 responder patients remained in remission for a period ranging from 4 to 12 months without clinically significant side effects or adverse events. One patient had to interrupt GBP treatment and be administered neuroleptics because of the reappearance of manic symptoms. Regarding response predictors, logistical regression analysis showed that the presence of panic disorder and alcohol abuse was associated with positive response. The results of the present study replicate prior studies indicating that GBP is an effective and well tolerated treatment in a large proportion of bipolar patients who are resistant to traditional mood stabilizers. More specifically, this drug appears to have antidepressant and anxiolytic properties. What is new in the present report is the suggestion that the utility of GBP in resistant bipolar disorder resides in its effectiveness against comorbid panic disorder and alcohol abuse.","Acetates/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Alcoholism/epidemiology, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Antimanic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/epidemiology, Comorbidity, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Resistance, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sampling Studies, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
10378545,Effects of a beta2-agonist on airway hyperreactivity in subjects with cervical spinal cord injury.,"DeLuca RV, Grimm DR, Lesser M, Bauman WA, Almenoff PL",Chest. 1999 Jun;115(6):1533-8.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Aerosolized ipratropium bromide or orally administered baclofen or oxybutynin chloride (Ditropan) block methacholine-associated airway hyperreactivity in subjects with chronic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI), whereas these agents do not inhibit airway hyperreactivity associated with the inhalation of histamine. The present study was performed to determine whether pretreatment with a beta2-agonist attenuates airway hyperresponsiveness in these subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with chronic cervical SCI previously demonstrating airway hyperreactivity were challenged with methacholine (n = 9) or histamine (n = 16) alone and, on a separate day, 25 min following inhalation of nebulized metaproterenol sulfate. RESULTS: Inhalation of the beta2-agonist was associated with an increase in provocative concentration causing a 20% decrease in FEV1 (PC20) values (geometric mean) from 1.01+/-2.76 to 20.54+/-6.24 mg/mL for methacholine and from 2.29+/-2.26 to 19.82+/-5.93 mg/mL for histamine. No correlation was found between specific PC20 values for individual subjects and percentage improvement in FEV1 (liter) following inhalation of metaproterenol sulfate and between PC20 values and baseline FEV1 percent. CONCLUSION: These data, combined with findings that patients with chronic high cervical SCI experience increased breathlessness following exposure to exogenous agents, suggest that long-term prophylactic beta2-agonist therapy may reduce respiratory symptoms associated with airway hyperreactivity in these patients.","Administration, Inhalation, Adrenergic beta-Agonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Bronchial Hyperreactivity/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Bronchial Provocation Tests, Bronchoconstriction/drug effects, Chronic Disease, Follow-Up Studies, Forced Expiratory Volume, Histamine/diagnostic use, Humans, Metaproterenol/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Methacholine Chloride/diagnostic use, Middle Aged, Nebulizers and Vaporizers, Neck, Respiratory Function Tests, Spinal Cord Injuries/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Treatment Outcome",-1

Intrathecal ziconotide has been recommended for approval by the FDA for the management of chronic pain. Spinally administered ziconotide produces analgesia by blocking neurotransmitter release from primary nociceptive afferents and prevents the propagation of pain signals to the brain. It has an advantage over intrathecal morphine in that there is no development of tolerance after prolonged use. Systemic toxicity is considerably reduced by administration of smaller doses intrathecally and selective delivery to the site of action in the nervous system. Nevertheless, there are neurological adverse effects due to delay in clearance of ziconotide from the neural tissues. Overall, ziconotide has a favourable risk/benefit ratio with advantages over several currently available intrathecal therapies for pain.","Animals, Calcium Channel Blockers/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease/drug therapy, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Pain/*drug therapy, omega-Conotoxins/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use",-1

A frequently cited consequence, however, is the high incidence of postoperative headaches. Much has been written regarding prevention of these headaches, but little has been written of their treatment. The authors review their extensive experience in suboccipital tumor removal and the medical management of postoperative headache, highlighting the recent use of a regimen of divalproex sodium and verapamil. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHODS: The charts of a consecutive series of patients having suboccipital craniotomies for CPA tumors were reviewed. Presence, duration, and severity of headache were noted. Medical treatments and their effectiveness were also noted. RESULTS: Between 1980 and 1997, 228 patients underwent suboccipital craniotomy for removal of CPA tumors. Of these patients, 124 (54.4%) complained of headache. For 62 (27.2%) the headaches persisted for more than a year after surgery. Twenty-nine patients (12.7%) received no relief from any medication. Ten of these patients received a regimen of divalproex sodium and verapamil, with all patients obtaining significant relief. CONCLUSION: Headache is a significant problem with the suboccipital approach for acoustic tumor removal. The majority of patients that complain of headache can be adequately treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If pain is unrelieved by NSAIDs, treatment becomes problematic. The authors' early experience with divalproex sodium/verapamil is encouraging and deserves further investigation as a treatment for these refractory cases.","Adult, Cerebellar Neoplasms/*surgery, *Cerebellopontine Angle, Craniotomy/adverse effects, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Headache/*drug therapy/*etiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuroma, Acoustic/*surgery, *Postoperative Complications, Retrospective Studies, Valproic Acid/administration & dosage, Verapamil/administration & dosage",-1

METHOD: Forty bipolar disorder patients aged 7 to 19 years, with a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode, enrolled in an open-label study of divalproex (2-8 weeks), followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled period (8 weeks). RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects (61%) showed > or =50% improvement in Mania Rating Scale (MRS) scores during the open-label period. Significant ( <.001) improvements from baseline were seen for mean scores of all efficacy measures, including the MRS, Manic Syndrome Scale, Behavior and Ideation Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Of the 23 subjects who discontinued the study during the open-label period, 6 (15%) discontinued for ineffectiveness, 6 (15%) for intolerance, 6 (15%) for noncompliance, and 6 (15%) for other reasons. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity, with the most common being headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and somnolence. Laboratory data results were unremarkable.

11562296,Medical treatment and neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury.,"Clausen T, Bullock R",Curr Pharm Des. 2001 Oct;7(15):1517-32.,"The goal of this article is to give an overview about the established current treatment concepts of traumatic brain injury, as well as an outlook on possible future developments in pharmacological neuroprotection. Modern medical treatment modalities of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including the preclinical management of severely head-injured patients, are reviewed. Since an increased intracranial pressure represents the most common complication of severe traumatic brain injury, frequently associated with the development of secondary brain damage, special emphasis was given to an updated treatment algorithm for this important condition. New insight into the pathophysiology of severe traumatic brain injury, especially the realization that brain damage develops sequentially, initiated several new treatment approaches aiming at the interruption of pathophysiological mechanisms leading to secondary brain injury. A high number of pharmacological substances have been tested for their ability to ameliorate secondary damage after TBI, or are currently under clinical trial. Although no drug has achieved this goal so far, the most promising of these therapeutical approaches, glutamate receptor antagonists, calcium channel antagonists, free radical scavengers, and cyclosporin A will be discussed in this review. Although a ""magical bullet"" for the treatment of traumatic brain injury has not been developed yet, several of the currently investigated neuroprotective strategies seem to be encouraging. A promising future approach might be to evaluate treatment strategies that combine several pharmacological agents, and possibly other treatment modalities, such as mild hypothermia, ""tailored"" according to the special pathology of patient subgroups, or even to every single patient in order to achieve an improvement in outcome after TBI.","Brain Injuries/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use, Cyclosporine/therapeutic use, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use, Forecasting, Free Radical Scavengers/therapeutic use, Humans, Intensive Care, Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use",-1

We determined FBM levels by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of 46 epilepsy patient plasma specimens (41 patients) and assessed medication toxicity and seizure frequency by a questionnaire. Thirty-six patients were treated with other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs); concomitant AED levels not in ranges believed to cause toxicity. FBM levels ranged from 9 to 134 microgram/ml, and were divided into three groups for analysis, resulting in low-range (9-36 microgram/ml), midrange (37-54 microgram/ml), and high-level (44-134 microgram/ml) groups. Anorexia and complaints of severe side effects were reported significantly more often in the high-level group as compared with the low- and midrange groups. Significantly more patients in the high-level group (10/13) reported decreased seizure frequency, as compared with 12 of 30 patients in the low- and midrange groups combined.

9846401,Vitamin B2 interference with TDx drugs-of-abuse assays.,"Kunsman GW, Levine B, Smith ML",J Forensic Sci. 1998 Nov;43(6):1225-7.,"Migraine is a headache condition found in significant frequency in the general population. One recent study has shown that riboflavin, Vitamin B2, is an effective prophylactic treatment for this headache condition. One subject in a recent study conducted by the Division of Forensic Toxicology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) was taking 200 mg of riboflavin twice daily for the prevention of migraine headaches. When that subject's urine was tested using Abbott TDx drugs-of-abuse assays a number of tests resulted in a MX BKG error and all samples had BLK I values greater than those observed with normal urine specimens. The MX BKG error occurs when the BLK I value is greater than the upper limit determined by the manufacturer for a particular assay. High BLK I values may result if the specimen being analyzed contains a fluorophore that will compete with the fluorescein-labeled antibody used in the assay. This error serves as a notification that an interfering substance may be present and the assay is not performing according to manufacturer-specifications. Upon termination of riboflavin therapy the subject's BLK I values began to decrease within 60 h of the last 200 mg dose. A second subject began chronic riboflavin use to confirm this interferent effect. Elevated BLK I values resulted within 3 h of a single 200 mg dose and MX BKG errors occurred 1 h after a second 400 mg dose. No false negative results were noted with either subject (both subjects used butalbital and the first subject also used hydrocodone and diazepam during the study), suggesting that riboflavin is not an adulterant. Riboflavin use, however, does interfere with the TDx DAU assays and may result in quantitative values being determined which are of questionable validity in the face of an elevated BLK I value or may result in only an MX BKG error and no quantitative value reported. It is unclear if the interfering fluorophore is simply riboflavin itself or a combination of riboflavin and its metabolic products. Results obtained on urine samples collected from individuals using prophylactic riboflavin for migraine prevention and analyzed by TDx may be of questionable validity. Such samples may require analysis utilizing another immunoassay technique that does not employ a fluorescein-labeled antibody.","Fluorescence Polarization Immunoassay/methods, Forensic Medicine/methods, Humans, Migraine Disorders/drug therapy, Reagent Kits, Diagnostic, Riboflavin/*chemistry, Sensitivity and Specificity, Street Drugs/urine, Substance Abuse Detection/*methods",-1

It begins during childhood and has a waxing and waning course. Coexisting obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attentional problems, and other behavioral features are common. Pathophysiology involves dysfunction in basal ganglia and related corticothalamic circuits. Many patients who present in clinical settings have mild to moderate symptoms and require only education, monitoring, and long-term follow-up. Those with more-severe symptoms require treatment, typically including both pharmacotherapy and nonmedication approaches. In addition to traditional neuroleptic treatment, a variety of agents such as clonidine, serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants can be used. Further investigation is needed in a variety of areas, including longitudinal follow-up studies of children, adolescents, and adults with Tourette's disorder; systematic investigation of psychiatric comorbidity and the heterogeneity of the disorder; clarification of the phenomenological similarities and differences between Tourette's disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder; and neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies of Tourette's disorder and related problems.","Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use, Clonidine/therapeutic use, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*complications, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/therapeutic use, Sympatholytics/therapeutic use, Tourette Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/etiology",-1

Twelve principles of migraine management were identified, covering screening, diagnosis, management and treatments: Almost all headaches are benign/primary and can be managed by all practising clinicians. Use questions/a questionnaire to assess the impact on daily living and everyday activities, for diagnostic screening and to aid management decisions. Share migraine management between the clinician and the patient. Provide individualised care for migraine and encourage patients to manage their migraine. Follow up patients, preferably with migraine calendars or diaries. Regularly re-evaluate the success of therapy using specific outcome measures and monitor the use of acute and prophylactic medications regularly. Adapt migraine management to changes that occur in the illness and its presentation over the years. Provide acute medication to all migraine patients and recommend it is taken at the appropriate time, during the attack. Provide rescue medication/symptomatic treatment for when the initial therapy fails. Offer to prescribe prophylactic medications, as well as lifestyle changes, to patients who have four or more migraine attacks per month or who are resistant to acute medications. Consider concurrent co-morbidities in the choice of appropriate prophylactic medication. Work with the patient to achieve comfort with mutually agreed upon treatment and ensure that it is practical for their lifestyle and headache presentation. Using these principles, practising clinicians can screen and diagnose their headache patients effectively and manage their migraine patients over the long-term natural history of the migraine process. In this way, the majority of migraine patients can be well treated in primary care, ensuring a structured and individualised approach to headache management, and conserving valuable healthcare resources.","Humans, Migraine Disorders/*diagnosis/*therapy, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Primary Health Care/*methods",-1

The purpose of this review is to summarize what is currently known concerning the nature and scope of chronic pain as a secondary condition to disability, specifically spinal cord injury, acquired amputations, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, neuromuscular disease, and postpolio syndrome. METHOD: What is known concerning the frequency, severity, impact, and treatment of pain in these specific conditions is reviewed, as are the factors that contribute to, or are associated with, adjustment to chronic pain in these disability groups. The authors conclude with several research questions that emerge from this knowledge, the answers to which will contribute to the long-term goal of the reduction of pain and suffering in persons with disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: The existing literature clearly documents that many persons with disabilities experience chronic pain.

Nevertheless, manual therapy is a frequently used method of treatment in this group of patients. METHODS: We performed a randomized, controlled trial that involved patients who had had back pain for at least three weeks but less than six months. We screened 1193 patients; 178 were found to be eligible and were randomly assigned to treatment groups; 23 of these patients subsequently dropped out of the study. The patients were treated either with one or more standard medical therapies (72 patients) or with osteopathic manual therapy (83 patients). We used a variety of outcome measures, including scores on the Roland-Morris and Oswestry questionnaires, a visual-analogue pain scale, and measurements of range of motion and straight-leg raising, to assess the results of treatment over a 12-week period. RESULTS: Patients in both groups improved during the 12 weeks. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in any of the primary outcome measures. The osteopathic-treatment group required significantly less medication (analgesics, antiinflammatory agents, and muscle relaxants) (P< 0.001) and used less physical therapy (0.2 percent vs. 2.6 percent, P<0.05). More than 90 percent of the patients in both groups were satisfied with their care. CONCLUSIONS: Osteopathic manual care and standard medical care had similar clinical results in patients with subacute low back pain. However, the use of medication was greater with standard care.","Adult, Analgesics/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Low Back Pain/drug therapy/*therapy, Male, *Manipulation, Orthopedic, Manipulation, Spinal, Middle Aged, Patient Satisfaction, Physical Therapy Modalities, Treatment Outcome",-1

The purpose of this study was to obtain information about incidence, etiology, clinical aspect, and consequences for diagnosis and therapy of this condition in childhood and adolescence. Heterotopic ossification was diagnosed in 32 patients (mean age, 14.8 years) with average time of onset of 4 months after traumatic brain injury, near drowning, strangulation, cerebral hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, or spinal cord injury. The sex ratio was not significant. In contrast to what has been found in adult studies, serum alkaline phosphatase was not elevated during heterotopic ossification formation. A persistent vegetative state for longer than 30 days proved to be a significant risk factor for heterotopic ossification. The incidence of neurogenic heterotopic ossification in children seems to be lower than in adults. A genetic predisposition to heterotopic ossification is suspected but not proven. As a prophylactic regimen against heterotopic ossification we use salicylates for those patients in a coma or persistent vegetative state with warm and painful swelling of a joint and consider continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion and botulinum toxin injection for those patients with severe spasticity. We prefer to wait at least 1 year after trauma before excision of heterotopic ossification.","Adult, Age of Onset, Brain Injuries/complications, Brain Neoplasms/complications, Cerebral Infarction/complications, Child, Child, Preschool, Encephalitis/complications, Female, France/epidemiology, Germany/epidemiology, Humans, Infant, Male, Myositis Ossificans/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology/*prevention &, control/surgery, Near Drowning/complications, Persistent Vegetative State/complications, Recurrence/prevention & control, Retrospective Studies, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications",-1

A retrospective study was performed to determine the frequency and nature of complications in 158 children who had undergone SDR at British Columbia's Children's Hospital from 1987 to 1996. Intraoperative, preoperative (immediate postoperative until discharge at approximately 7 days) and postdischarge complications occurred in 3.8, 43.6 and 30% of patients, respectively. The most common intraoperative complication was aspiration pneumonia, which was experienced by 2 patients (1.3%). Perioperatively, sensory changes were found in 8.9% of the children, and transient urinary retention in 4.4%. Complications after discharge included back pain starting more than 6 months after surgery in 10.8%, sensory changes in 13.9%, and neurogenic bladder or bowel problems in 12.7%. Persistent sensory changes occurred in 3.8%, were not important functionally, and tended to occur in patients with the largest amount of dorsal root tissue cut. In 8 patients (5.1%), bladder and/or bowel dysfunction attributed to the SDR was present at the latest follow-up, although in only 2 patients (1.3%) this dysfunction was a definite complication of the rhizotomy. The use of pudendal monitoring and/or cutting less than 50% of the S2 roots may have been associated with a lower incidence of long-term sphincter dysfunction. Data about the nature and frequency of complications may result in further modifications to the SDR procedure, and is critical for counseling about SDR and alternative options available for treatment of the child with spastic cerebral palsy.","Adolescent, Back Pain/etiology, Cerebral Palsy/*surgery, Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/surgery, Retrospective Studies, Rhizotomy/*adverse effects, Sensation Disorders/etiology, Spinal Nerve Roots/*surgery, Urinary Incontinence/etiology",-1

The effects of tizanidine on exteroceptive suppression (ES) of the temporalis muscle were examined in eighteen patients with chronic tension-type headache with disorder of pericranial muscles, before and two weeks after the administration of tizanidine. The left mental nerve was stimulated, under the maximal voluntary contraction of the temporalis muscles. Two types of stimulation were used: weak stimulation with four times the sensory threshold, and strong stimulation with 10 times the sensory threshold. The rectified electromyographic activity was recorded from the right temporalis muscle. ES2 produced by four times the sensory threshold was lengthened after tizanidine administration. This fact suggests that tizanidine improves the inhibitory function in the central nervous system, and then relieves headache. However, ES produced by 10 times the sensory threshold did not change. This suggests that the effect of tizanidine may be relatively mild. The interneurones mediating ES2 may be modified by the alpha 2 agonist.","Clonidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Electric Stimulation, Humans, Muscle Contraction/drug effects, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Temporal Muscle/*drug effects/physiopathology, Tension-Type Headache/*drug therapy/physiopathology",-1

Subjective pain level and impairment in performing daily activities were rated utilizing a 3-point scale at time 0 and at optimal dosage time (T1). GBP was initiated at 300 mg daily and titrated, until pain control was achieved without new adverse effects, to a maximum dose of 1,200 mg daily. CBZ or LMT were reduced to a level which no longer produced adverse effects, although resulting in a lack of efficacy in relieving pain. Pain control was obtained in all patients but 1, with no side effects. The plasma level analysis, performed in 5 patients, resulted in normal values. The mean dosages at T1 were: group 1 CBZ 400 mg and GBP 850 mg daily; group 2 LMT 150 mg and GBP 780 mg daily.

Glutaric, 3-OH-glutaric, and glutaconic acids are excreted in the urine, particularly during intercurrent illness. The enzyme may be assayed in leukocytes, cultured fibroblasts and chorionic villi. Twelve new cases, 9 months-16 years of age, are reported, comprising all known cases of GA-I in Sweden and Norway. Ten had a severe dystonic-dyskinetic disorder, one had a mild hyperkinetic disorder, and one was asymptomatic. Two children died in a state of hyperthermia. Carnitine deficiency and malnutrition developed in patients with severe dystonia and dysphagia, which necessitated substitution and gastrostomy. A slowly progressive dyskinetic disorder developed in spite of adequate early dietary treatment in one subject. Macrocephaly was found in three.

Neuropsychological testing of 8 of 12 subjects demonstrated receptive language function to be superior to expressive language and motor function. Cognitive functions were obviously less affected than motor functions.

Despite its biological activity in vitro, there have not been any prior reports of efficacy in the treatment of human malignant gliomas. We report a 44-year-old female with a recurrent, multicentric, malignant glioma who experienced a durable remission lasting more than four years. The patient initially presented with seizures caused by a biopsy-proven anaplastic astrocytoma of the frontal lobe. The patient was treated with radiation therapy and Procarbazine-CCNU-Vincristine (PCV). However, the tumor progressed and extended to the corpus callosum with midline shift, refractory to four cycles of continuous 72-h infusion of BCNU/Cisplatinum. Additional enhancing lesions appeared in the left frontal and left temporal lobes. The patient was started on sodium phenylbutyrate, 18 g daily in three divided oral doses, and reduced to 9 g/day and eventually to 4.5 g/day to eliminate mild, reversible side effects. Four years later, the patient has a KPS functional score of 100%. Phenylbutyrate is a well-tolerated, oral agent that shows potential for the treatment of malignant gliomas.

Clonidine only was employed in order to treat flushes observed in rosacea. Rilmenidine is a central hypotensive drug which acts more specifically than clonidine on imidazoline receptors and which has no sedative side effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of rilmenidine 1 mg/d in the treatment of rosacea. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 41 patients suffering from typical rosacea were selected in this randomised double blind study rilmenidine versus placebo. The study comprised an 1-month observation period without treatment followed by 3 months of treatment. The major assessment criteria was the proportion of responders at the end of the treatment period. Responders were defined as patients showing a decrease of more than 50 p. 100 in the count of papules and pustules. Minor criterias were the variation of the number of flushes, self-evaluated by the patient and the variation of the redness of the face, noted by the investigator on a scale from 0 to 5. RESULTS: Fifteen patients treated by rilmenidine (R) and 19 patients receiving the placebo (P) were evaluated. The proportion of responders was 69.2 p. 100 in group R and 57.1 p. 100 in group P (p = 0.69). The variations of the number of papules and pustules and of the redness of the face were not significantly different in the two groups. The decrease in the number of flushes was higher in group R (around -13) than in group P (around -5), but the difference was not really significant (p = 0.076). Arterial pressure decreased in 3 patients in group R and in 2 patients in group P. Minor side effects were noted in a similar proportion of patients in the two groups. DISCUSSION: Rilmenidine is not efficient in reducing the number of papules and pustules but could decrease the number of flushes. Nevertheless, many patients were lost for follow-up and because of a major placebo effect, the conclusions of this study are not strong enough. Another study including more patients and using evaluation criteria based on the vascular components of rosacea could perhaps confirm this hypothesis.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use, Adult, Double-Blind Method, Drug Tolerance, Female, Flushing/prevention & control, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Oxazoles/*therapeutic use, Placebos, Rosacea/*drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

A 49-year-old male with DS experienced progressively worsening gait and bladder dysfunction. Following Poser criteria, the patient was diagnosed with laboratory-supported definite MS. Ten days following diagnosis the patient experienced dysestetic paroxysmal pain at the pelvic level (an uncommon complaint in MS) which was initially addressed with carbamazepine, resulting in mild relief and adverse effects consisting of increased motor deficit and decreased daytime alertness. A titration combination of lamotrigine and gabapentin, two relatively new antiepileptic drugs which have been utilized individually for a number of neurological symptoms, resulted in significant reduction in pain frequency and intensity, with no adverse effects. This case study presents details of the first reported association of DS and MS, between which the pathogenetic relationship remains unclear. The presence of a rare symptom complaint in MS, as well as the effective combination of lamotrigine and gabapentin for treating this symptom, without adverse effects is an additional interesting aspect of this case.","Acetates/therapeutic use, *Amines, Brain/pathology, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Down Syndrome/*complications/physiopathology, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/therapeutic use, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications/drug therapy/physiopathology, Pelvic Pain/etiology, Triazines/therapeutic use, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine staff provided their perceptions of end-of-life care for 99 decedents from 74 residential care/assisted living facilities and nursing homes in four states as part of a larger cohort study. Staff were interviewed retrospectively regarding care provided during residents' last month of life. MEASUREMENTS: Staff reported on 11 areas of end-of-life care, describing the importance of each area and the level of improvement they felt was indicated. Weighted ""need for change"" scores were calculated as the product of perceived importance and need for improvement. RESULTS: Both residential care/assisted living and nursing home staff reported a need for more staff education and nursing assistant time, as well as more use of volunteers. The two lowest ranked items for both facility types were involvement of hospice and encouragement for staff to attend funeral services. Nursing home staff perceived a greater need for improvement than residential care/assisted living staff in all 11 areas. CONCLUSION: Results underscore the staffing demands of end-of-life care across facility types, and staff desires to be able to provide quality care throughout the dying process.","Assisted Living Facilities, *Attitude of Health Personnel, Cohort Studies, Humans, *Long-Term Care, *Nursing Homes, Terminal Care/*psychology, United States",-1
9099150,Clinical epidemiology of nocturnal leg cramps in male veterans.,"Haskell SG, Fiebach NH",Am J Med Sci. 1997 Apr;313(4):210-4.,"This article describes patients with nocturnal leg cramps concerning their age, medical problems, and medications, and reviews any medical evaluation performed for the complaint of nocturnal leg cramps. Provided is a retrospective chart review of 50 patients who took quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps. These patients were identified through computerized pharmacy records. A control group was chosen from age-matched patients who took medications other than quinine during the study period. In a university-affiliated Veterans Administration hospital, patients with nocturnal leg cramps had a significantly higher median number of medical problems than controls. Cardiovascular diseases and neurological diseases were significantly more common in patients with nocturnal leg cramps (cases) than in those without (controls) (82% versus 64% and 36% versus 18%, respectively). The most striking differences between patients with cramps and controls were peripheral vascular disease (34% versus 12%, P = 0.09) and peripheral neurological deficit (12% versus 0%, P = 0.012). Patients with nocturnal leg cramps were prescribed significantly more medications than were controls, but no specific medication or type of medication was prescribed more frequently to patients with cramps (other than quinine). Results suggested that men with nocturnal leg cramps have greater medical comorbidity and are prescribed more medications than age-matched control patients. Unlike in previous studies, no evidence was found that specific medications, such as diuretics, betaagonists, or calcium-channel antagonists are associated with nighttime cramps. The significantly increased frequency of peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neurologic deficits in patients with nocturnal leg cramps raised the possibility that these problems contribute to the occurrence of cramps. Although the size of the study and its methodologic limitations preclude definitive conclusions, areas for research to clarify the clinical epidemiology of nocturnal leg cramps are suggested.","Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cardiovascular Diseases/complications, Case-Control Studies, Circadian Rhythm, Connecticut/epidemiology, Hospitals, Veterans, Humans, Leg, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/complications/drug therapy/*epidemiology, Nervous System Diseases/complications, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/complications, Peripheral Vascular Diseases/complications, Quinine/therapeutic use, Retrospective Studies",-1

Be sure that a woman of childbearing potential is aware of any potential risks. Involve patients in their care to maximize compliance. Consider co-morbidity. Choose a drug based on its proven efficacy, the patient's preferences and headache profile, the drug's side-effects, and the presence or absence of coexisting or co-morbid disease. Drugs that have documented high efficacy and mild to moderate adverse events (AEs) include beta-blockers, amitriptyline, and divalproex. Drugs that have lower documented efficacy and mild to moderate AEs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin, topiramate, riboflavin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.","Analgesics/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/statistics & numerical data, Humans, Migraine Disorders/drug therapy/*prevention & control",-1
14519710,Analgesic effect of the synthetic cannabinoid CT-3 on chronic neuropathic pain: a randomized controlled trial.,"Karst M, Salim K, Burstein S, Conrad I, Hoy L, Schneider U",JAMA. 2003 Oct 1;290(13):1757-62.,"CONTEXT: 1',1'dimethylheptyl-Delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol-11-oic acid (CT-3), a potent analog of THC-11-oic acid, produces marked antiallodynic and analgesic effects in animals without evoking the typical effects described in models of cannabinoids. Therefore, CT-3 may be an effective analgesic for poorly controlled resistant neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the analgesic efficacy and safety of CT-3 in chronic neuropathic pain in humans. DESIGN AND SETTING: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial conducted in Germany from May-September 2002. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one patients (8 women and 13 men) aged 29 to 65 years (mean, 51 years) who had a clinical presentation and examination consistent with chronic neuropathic pain (for at least 6 months) with hyperalgesia (n = 21) and allodynia (n = 7). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to two 7-day treatment orders in a crossover design. Two daily doses of CT-3 (four 10-mg capsules per day) or identical placebo capsules were given during the first 4 days and 8 capsules per day were given in 2 daily doses in the following 3 days. After a washout and baseline period of 1 week each, patients crossed over to the second 7-day treatment period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog scale (VAS) and verbal rating scale scores for pain; vital sign, hematologic and blood chemistry, and electrocardiogram measurements; scores on the Trail-Making Test and the Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale; and adverse effects. RESULTS: The mean differences over time for the VAS values in the CT-3-placebo sequence measured 3 hours after intake of study drug differed significantly from those in the placebo-CT-3 sequence (mean [SD], -11.54 [14.16] vs 9.86 [21.43]; P =.02). Eight hours after intake of the drug, the pain scale differences between groups were less marked. No dose response was observed. Adverse effects, mainly transient dry mouth and tiredness, were reported significantly more often during CT-3 treatment (mean [SD] difference, -0.67 [0.50] for CT-3-placebo sequence vs 0.10 [0.74] for placebo-CT-3 sequence; P =.02). There were no significant differences with respect to vital signs, blood tests, electrocardiogram, Trail-Making Test, and Addiction Research Center Inventory-Marijuana scale. No carryover or period effects were observed except on the Trail-Making Test. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, CT-3 was effective in reducing chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. No major adverse effects were observed.","Adult, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Dronabinol/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Hyperalgesia/complications/drug therapy, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/complications/*drug therapy, Pain Measurement",-1

Taken orally daily for 12 weeks, tolperisone HCL (Mydocalm) in a dose of 150 milligrams (mgs) twice daily significantly improved subjective complaints such as muscle cramps, heaviness of the legs, startle attacks, flexor spasms and repeated falls. An overall subjective improvement was observed in 75% of the patients on tolperisone HCL and 39% of the placebo group (P = 0.002). When objectively assessed spastic muscle tone in the abductors, stiffness of Achilles and spontaneous ankle clonus were significantly reduced in tolperisone HCL group (P values = 0.001, 0.04, and 0.0001, respectively). Walking ability and speed of walking was also significantly improved. The drug is most effective in relieving symptoms of stage I and stage II disease. Some adverse effects like muscle pain, generalized body weakness and dizziness were recorded in patients taking the drug but all were minor and self limited, none requiring discontinuation of treatment. It is concluded that tolperisone is a well tolerated and efficacious drug for symptomatic treatment of neurolathyrism.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Child, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology, Plant Poisoning/*complications, Tolperisone/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome, Vitamin B Complex/therapeutic use",-1

12562316,Review of esomeprazole in the treatment of acid disorders.,Johnson DA,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2003 Feb;4(2):253-64.,"Esomeprazole (Nexium, AstraZeneca) is the (S)-isomer of omeprazole and the first proton pump inhibitor to be developed as an optical isomer. Esomeprazole has an improved pharmacokinetic profile, resulting in increased systemic exposure and less interindividual variability compared with omeprazole, and more effective suppression of gastric acid production compared with other proton pump inhibitors. In several large, double-blind, randomised trials, significantly higher rates of endoscopically-confirmed healing of erosive oesophagitis and resolution of heartburn have been achieved in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease receiving 8 weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. compared with those receiving omeprazole 20 mg o.d. or lansoprazole 30 mg o.d. In the maintenance of healed erosive oesophagitis, esomeprazole 10, 20 or 40 mg o.d. was significantly more effective than placebo in two 6-month, randomised, double-blind trials. Additionally, esomeprazole 20 mg o.d. was more effective than lansoprazole 15 mg in the maintenance of healed erosive oesophagitis in another 6-month, randomised, double-blind trial. Healing of oesophagitis was also effectively maintained by esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. in a 12-month non-comparative trial. Esomeprazole 20 or 40 mg o.d. effectively relieved heartburn in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease without oesophagitis in two 4-week, placebo-controlled trials. Clinical trials have shown that triple therapy with esomeprazole 40 mg o.d. in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin produced Helicobacter pylori eradication rates similar to those obtained using triple therapy involving twice-daily dosing with other proton pump inhibitors. Esomeprazole is well-tolerated, with a spectrum and incidence of adverse events similar to those associated with omeprazole.","Anti-Ulcer Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Esomeprazole, Esophagitis, Peptic/drug therapy/microbiology, Gastric Acid/secretion, Gastroesophageal Reflux/drug therapy, Helicobacter Infections/complications/drug therapy, Helicobacter pylori, Humans, Omeprazole/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Proton Pump Inhibitors, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1

Lamotrigine works at voltage-sensitive sodium channels, thereby stabilising the neuronal membrane and inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and aspartate. Early preclinical animal studies indicate its broad-spectrum efficacy, which was later confirmed in clinical trials. Multiple randomised, placebo-controlled and comparative trials demonstrate its efficacy against partial and secondarily generalised seizures. Open-label trials show its efficacy against generalised seizures, especially absence seizures of childhood absence epilepsy and generalised seizures of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Lamotrigine has a wide clinical dose range and possesses favourable pharmacokinetic properties. It has a good tolerability and safety profile, which enhance compliance. Its small risk of serious skin rash should be weighed against its potential benefits when choosing lamotrigine on an individual basis. Lamotrigine is an excellent therapeutic option in epilepsy.","Abnormalities, Drug-Induced, Animals, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Child, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Epilepsy/*drug therapy/etiology/psychology, Female, Humans, Pregnancy, Quality of Life, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sodium Channel Blockers/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Triazines/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use",-1

OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the relationship of coffee and caffeine intake to risk of death from suicide. METHODS: We conducted a 10-year follow-up study (1980 to 1990) in an ongoing cohort of 86 626 US female registered nurses aged 34 to 59 years in 1980, who were free of diagnosed coronary heart disease, stroke, or cancer. Information on coffee and caffeine intake was collected by a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire in 1980. Deaths from suicide were determined by physician review of death certificates. RESULTS: Fifty-six cases of suicide occurred during 832 704 person-years of observation. Compared with non-drinkers of coffee, the age-adjusted relative risk of suicide in women who consumed two to three cups per day was 0.34 (95% confidence interval [CI, 0.17 to 0.68) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86) in women who consumed four or more cups per day (P for linear trend=.002). These findings remained essentially unchanged after adjusting for a broad range of potential confounding factors, including smoking habit, alcohol intake, medication use (diazepam and phenothiazine), history of comorbid disease (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes), marital status, and self-reported stress. A strong inverse relationship was similarly found for caffeine intake from all sources and risk of suicide. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a strong inverse association between coffee intake and risk of suicide. Whether regular intake of coffee or caffeine has clinically significant effects on the maintenance of affect or the prevention of depression merits further investigation in clinical trials and population-based prospective studies.","Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Alcohol Drinking, Antidepressive Agents/pharmacology, Caffeine/pharmacology, Cause of Death, Central Nervous System Stimulants/pharmacology, *Coffee, Cohort Studies, Comorbidity, *Drinking Behavior, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Risk Factors, Smoking/adverse effects, Suicide/*prevention & control/statistics & numerical data",-1

In this study it is shown that F-wave amplitudes can also be used to document changes of motor neuron excitability as an effect of the therapy with a motorized exercise-cycle, which moves the legs of paraplegic patients in a way similar to cycling. Ten F-waves were recorded immediately before and after the therapy with a motorized exercise-cycle in 70 legs of 35 patients with spastic paraparesis. Mean F-wave amplitude, mean F-wave/M-response ratio and maximum F-wave/M-response ratio were significantly lower after therapy than before.

9076868,Effectiveness of gabapentin in controlling spasticity: a quantitative study.,"Priebe MM, Sherwood AM, Graves DE, Mueller M, Olson WH",Spinal Cord. 1997 Mar;35(3):171-5.,"The purpose of this investigation was to study the effectiveness of gabapentin in controlling spasticity in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) using a surface EMG-based quantitative assessment technique called the brain motor control assessment (BMCA). Six men from a Veterans Affairs Medical Center with spasticity due to traumatic SCI were studied as part of a multi-center, placebo-controlled, cross-over, clinical trial of gabapentin. Spasticity was evaluated using multi-channel surface EMG recordings of muscles in the lower extremities, abdomen and low back before and during treatment with oral gabapentin or placebo. Gabapentin or placebo was given orally in doses 400 mg three times daily for 48 h. Following a 10 day wash-out period subjects were crossed-over to receive the medication not received the first time. This was followed by an elective open-label extension. Group results during the controlled trial did not reach statistical significance at the dosage used. One subject demonstrated a dramatic improvement in spasticity that was apparent both clinically and with the BMCA. Other subjects demonstrated modest improvements which were seen in the BMCA but not recognized clinically. During the open label extension, the four subjects who participated experienced important clinical improvements with higher doses (to 3600 mg/day). These improvements were often in components of spasticity in which the BMCA had detected subclinical changes during the cross-over trial. A seventh subject was studied using the BMCA at doses of 1200 mg T.I.D. gabapentin, off gabapentin and 800 mg T.I.D. gabapentin and demonstrated quantitatively a dose-related effect with higher doses of gabapentin which matched clinical observations. Gabapentin at doses of 400 mg T.I.D. may be effective in controlling some features of spasticity in persons with SCI. Higher doses provide greater control of spasticity, and controlled studies using higher doses are needed to evaluate gabapentin's efficacy.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Cross-Over Studies, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Electromyography, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Movement/physiology, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology/physiopathology, Parasympatholytics/*therapeutic use, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",1
11683664,Has basic research contributed to chronic pain treatment?,"Jensen TS, Gottrup H, Kasch H, Nikolajsen L, Terkelsen AJ, Witting N",Acta Anaesthesiol Scand. 2001 Oct;45(9):1128-35.,"Our understanding of nociceptive processing and of plastic changes after persistent noxious input has increased immensely within the last two decades. It is now clear that long-lasting noxious stimulation or damage to the nervous system give rise to a neuronal hyperexcitability and that this sensitisation of the nervous system plays an important role for development and maintenance of chronic pain. The manifestations of such hyperexcitability are numerous and include among others: increased neuronal response to a suprathreshold stimulus, expansion of the peripheral areas from where a central neurone can be activated and the recruitment of previous non-responding nociceptive neurones. Furthermore, it has been possible to modulate this neuronal hyperexcitability by the discovery of molecular targets for pain, by sequencing DNA of ion channels and receptors and by development of new molecules that exert their effects on these molecular targets. The changes in responsiveness appear to be partly time and intensity dependent and partly dependent on the cause of injury. Whereas relatively short-lasting and moderate noxious input leads to reversible plastic changes, more intense and long-lasting noxious stimulation implies a risk for persistent and more profound alterations in transmitters, receptors, ion channels and in neuronal connectivity. Despite the explosion of new knowledge in pain processing and in molecular background for neuroplasticity, this progress has unfortunately not resulted in a corresponding improvement of our ability to treat chronic pain. The number of patients with chronic unrelieved pain is still high and newer types of treatment have so far not resulted in a substantially better treatment. Nevertheless, there is now an ongoing systematic research in which chronic pain conditions are assessed in a fashion so that mechanisms underlying pain can be dissected. Moreover, controlled clinical trials together with systematic reviews are carried out which in the future should permit formulation of treatment algorithms for chronic pain. Finally, it is likely that the development of new specific types of treatment will show efficacy if they are evaluated and analysed not on the global pain experience, but more specifically on those targets and elements of the pain experience they are aimed to deal with.","Animals, Chronic Disease, Humans, Pain/metabolism/physiopathology/prevention & control, *Pain Management",-1

BACKGROUND: Tizanidine is an alpha2-adrenergic agonist that inhibits the release of norepinephrine at both the spinal cord and brain, with antinociceptive effects that are independent of the endogenous opioid system. Previous open-label studies have suggested the drug may be effective for treatment of chronic daily headache. METHODS: Two hundred patients completed a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period, with 134 fulfilling selection criteria and then randomized to tizanidine or placebo. Ninety-two patients completed at least 8 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 45; placebo, n = 47), and 85 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment (tizanidine, n = 44; placebo, n = 41). Most patients (77%) met the diagnostic criteria for migraine of the International Headache Society; 23% had either chronic migrainous headache or chronic tension-type headache. Tizanidine was slowly titrated over 4 weeks to 24 mg or the maximum dose tolerated (mean, 18 mg; SD, 6.4; median, 20.0; range, 2 to 24), divided equally over three dose intervals per day. Overall headache index ([headache days x average intensity x duration in hours]/28 days) was the primary end point. RESULTS: Tizanidine was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the overall headache index (P =.0025), as well as mean headache days per week (P =.0193), severe headache days per week (P =.0211), average headache intensity (P =.0108), peak headache intensity (P =.0020), and mean headache duration (P =.0127). The mean percentage improvement during the last 4 weeks of treatment with tizanidine versus placebo was 54% versus 19% for the headache index (P =.0144), 55% versus 21% for severe headache days (P =.0331), 35% versus 19% for headache duration (P =.0142), 35% versus 20% for peak headache intensity (P =.0106), 33% versus 20% for average headache intensity (P =.0281), and 30% versus 22% for total headache days (P =.0593). Patients receiving tizanidine also scored higher ratings of overall headache improvement on a visual analog scale (P =.0069). There was no statistically significant difference in outcome for patients with chronic migraine versus those with only migrainous or tension-type headache. Adverse effects reported by more than 10% of the patients included somnolence (47%), dizziness (24%), dry mouth (23%), and asthenia (19%). Dropouts due to adverse events did not differ significantly between tizanidine and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The results support tizanidine as an effective prophylactic adjunct for chronic daily headache, including migraine, migrainous headache, and tension-type headache. These results also suggest the possible importance of an alpha2-adrenergic mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of this spectrum of headache disorders.","Adolescent, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use, Adult, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Female, Headache Disorders/classification/*prevention & control, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Treatment Outcome",1

BACKGROUND: Headaches that are chronic, daily, and aggravated by medication overuse are particularly difficult to treat. METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients with transformed migraine and analgesic overuse were treated with inpatient pharmacologic therapy alone or with inpatient pharmacologic therapy combined with biofeedback-assisted relaxation. All patients then were followed prospectively for 3 years. RESULTS: Both treatment groups exhibited similar levels of improvement immediately following treatment and for 1 year thereafter. At year 3, participants receiving combined treatment showed greater sustained improvement on two of three outcome measures assessed (ie, fewer days of headache and reduced consumption of analgesic medication). In addition, a greater number of patients assigned to pharmacologic treatment alone relapsed (ie, resumed overuse of analgesics) compared to patients receiving combined treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a combination of pharmacologic and behavioral treatment is more effective than drug therapy alone in the long-term management of transformed migraine with analgesic overuse. Confirmation of these findings, as well as extension to other forms of behavioral and cognitive-behavioral treatment, is required.","Adult, Analgesics/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Biofeedback, Psychology, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hospitalization, Humans, Male, Migraine Disorders/chemically induced/*drug therapy/therapy, Prospective Studies, Relaxation Therapy",-1

The extensive clinical trial database of A-L has allowed a comprehensive evaluation of its tolerability and safety in a total of 1869 patients (including 243 children aged 5-12 years and 368 children aged < 5 years). The most commonly reported and possibly related adverse effects following A-L therapy involved the gastro-intestinal (abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and central nervous (headache, dizziness) systems. Pruritus and rash were reported by < 2% of patients. More than 90% of the reported adverse events, many of which overlapped considerably with the clinical symptomatology or evolution of acute malaria, were rated mild to moderate in intensity. Compared to A-L, significantly higher incidences of vomiting and pruritus were observed with chloroquine, dizziness, nausea and vomiting with mefloquine, somnolence with pyrimethamine + sulfadoxine, and vomiting and dizziness with quinine. There were no serious or persistent neurological side-effects related to A-L administration. A-L did not lead to any clinically relevant alterations of the laboratory parameters. Serial electrocardiographic data were available for 713 patients. The frequency of QT interval prolongations was similar to or lower than that observed with chloroquine, mefloquine, or artesunate + mefloquine; these changes were considerably less frequent than with quinine or halofantrine. All patients with QT prolongation remained asymptomatic and no adverse clinical cardiac events were reported. Artemether-lumefantrine can thus be expected to show, both in children and in adults, a favourable safety profile for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated, P. falciparum malaria; it could as well be a reserve treatment option for travellers to endemic countries.","Administration, Oral, Antimalarials/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, *Artemisinins, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Drug Combinations, Ethanolamines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Fluorenes/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Malaria, Falciparum/*drug therapy, Male, Mefloquine/administration & dosage/adverse effects, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Sesquiterpenes/*administration & dosage/adverse effects",-1

The aim of this work was to assess, in streptozocin-induced diabetic rats, the pharmacological activity to several analgesic drugs known to be effective (clomipramine, amitriptyline, desipramine, clonidine, lidocaine), ineffective (aspirin), or with a doubtful effectiveness (morphine) in human painful diabetic neuropathy. The animals were submitted to a mechanical pain test (paw pressure) and the ability of the drugs to reverse diabetes-induced hyperalgesia was tested. The tested antidepressants (0.125-8 mg/kg, i.v.) were slightly effective in diabetic rats; amitriptyline and clomipramine induced a weak effect, whereas desipramine was more active, suggesting noradrenergic specificity. This was confirmed by the effectiveness of clonidine (50, 100, 150 micrograms/kg, s.c.). Lidocaine (1-9 mg/kg, i.v.) had prolonged efficacy on mechanical hyperalgesia. Aspirin (100 mg/kg, i.v.) was without effect and morphine (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.v.) induced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect but at doses twice as high as those used in normal rats.

One hundred three patients were randomly assigned to receive double-blind treatment with either gabapentin (dosed flexibly between 600 and 3,600 mg/day) or placebo for 8 weeks. No overall drug/placebo difference was observed in scores on the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS) (p = 0.606). A post hoc analysis was used to evaluate the more severely ill patients as defined by the primary outcome measure (PAS score > or = 20). In this population, the gabapentin-treated patients showed significant improvement in the PAS change score (p = 0.04). In patients with a PAS score of 20 or greater, women showed a greater response than men regardless of treatment. Adverse events were consistent with the known side effect profile of gabapentin and included somnolence, headache, and dizziness. One patient experienced a serious adverse event during the study. No deaths were reported. The results of this study suggest that gabapentin may have anxiolytic effects in more severely ill patients with panic disorder.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Agoraphobia/drug therapy/psychology, *Amines, Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Panic Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Sex Characteristics, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

The central nervous system and other body areas were examined with T1 sequences before and after intravenous injection of the contrast medium. Overall safety was very good and no clinically relevant changes were evident as regards heart rate and venous blood oxygen saturation after injection. No adverse event or discomfort was experienced by conscious patients that could with certainty be related to the contrast medium, but slight movements were observed in two sedated patients that could be related to the injection. Comparing pre- and post-injection images, additional diagnostic information could be obtained from the latter in 41 patients (82%). In these images, the number of lesions detected increased and they were generally better delineated and their size more easily estimated.

In order to study it's underlying mechanism we characterized the neurological profile of SCI subjects with (SCIP) and without (SCINP) chronic pain. Characterization comprised of thermal threshold testing for warmth, cold and heat pain and tactile sensibility testing of touch, graphesthesia and identification of speed of movement of touch stimuli on the skin. In addition, spontaneously painful areas were mapped in SCIP and evoked pathological pain--allodynia, hyperpathia and wind-up pain evaluated for both groups. Both SCIP and SCINP showed similar reductions in both thermal and tactile sensations. In both groups thermal sensations were significantly more impaired than tactile sensations. Chronic pain was present only in skin areas below the lesion with impaired or absent temperature and heat-pain sensibilities. Conversely, all the thermally impaired skin areas in SCIP were painful while painfree areas in the same subjects were normal. In contrast, chronic pain could be found in skin areas without any impairment in tactile sensibilities. Allodynia could only be elicited in SCIP and a significantly higher incidence of pathologically evoked pain (i.e. hyperpathia and wind-up pain) was seen in the chronic pain areas compared to SCINP. We conclude that damage to the spinothalamic tract (STT) is a necessary condition for the occurrence of chronic pain following SCI. However, STT lesion is not a sufficient condition since it could also be found in SCINP. The abnormal evoked pain seen in SCIP is probably due to neuronal hyperexcitability in these subjects. The fact that apparently identical sensory impairments manifest as chronic pain and hyperexcitability in one subject but not in another implies that either genetic predisposition or subtle differences in the nature of spinal injury determine the emergence of chronic pain following SCI.","Adult, Chronic Disease, Female, Humans, Male, Neural Pathways/physiology, *Pain Measurement, Physical Stimulation, Spinal Cord/physiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications/*psychology, Thalamus/physiology, Touch/physiology",-1

METHOD: In the present study, the efficacy of buspirone was investigated in patients with social phobia using a 12-week double-blind placebo-controlled design. Thirty social phobic patients (DSM-IV) were treated with either buspirone 30 mg daily or placebo. Efficacy of treatment was measured using the Social Phobia Scale (subscores anxiety and avoidance) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. RESULTS: Taking a reduction of 50% or more on the Social Phobia Scale as a criterion for clinically relevant improvement, only 1 patient on buspirone and 1 on placebo were classified as responder to treatment. A subjective and clinically relevant improvement was reported by 4 patients (27%) on buspirone and 2 patients (13%) on placebo. There were no statistically significant differences between buspirone and placebo on any of the outcome measures. Generally speaking, buspirone was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The results of the study do not support the results of open studies, in which a reduction of social anxiety and social avoidance was reported in patients with social phobia treated with buspirone.","Buspirone/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Humans, Phobic Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Placebos, Treatment Outcome",-1

STUDY DESIGN AND TREATMENT: After screening, a 4-week, single-blind, placebo baseline period was followed by a 12-week, double-blind, treatment period. The 12-week treatment period consisted of a 4-week titration phase and an 8-week stable-dosing phase. During the 4-week titration phase, patients were started on one 300-mg capsule of gabapentin or matching placebo. Patients were titrated weekly from 900 mg/day (end of week 1) to 2400 mg/day (end of week 4) and had to be receiving a stable dose of study medication by the end of the titration period. Study medication was to be given on a three-times-a-day dosing regimen. METHODS: The study hypothesis was defined a priori as a lower 4-week migraine rate during the second stabilization period for the gabapentin-treated patients as compared with the placebo-treated patients. The analyses were performed with the 4-week migraine rate at baseline as a covariate and center as a blocking factor. RESULTS: At seven participating centers, 143 patients with migraine were randomized in a 2:1 ratio and received either gabapentin (n = 98) or matching placebo (n = 45). Thirty-three patients (24.1%) discontinued prematurely from the study, including 24 (24.5%) of 98 gabapentin-treated patients and 9 (20.0%) of 45 placebo-treated patients; the majority of patients discontinued due to adverse events (16 [16.3%] of 98 gabapentin-treated patients; 4 [8.9%] of 45 placebo-treated patients). Patients included in the analysis were evenly balanced for age, sex, race, weight, and height. The majority of these patients were white (80 [92.0%] of 87) and women (72 [82.8%] of 87), with a mean age of approximately 39.4 years and a history of migraine episodes for a mean of about 21 years. At the end of the 12-week treatment phase, the median 4-week migraine rate was 2.7 for the gabapentin-treated patients maintained on a stable dose of 2400 mg/day and 3.5 for the placebo-treated patients (P =.006), compared with 4.2 and 4.1, respectively, during the baseline period. Additionally, 26 (46.4%) of 56 patients receiving a stable dose of 2400 mg/day gabapentin and 5 (16.1%) of 31 patients receiving placebo showed at least a 50% reduction in the 4-week migraine rate (P =.008). The average number of days per 4 weeks with migraine was also statistically significant and favored gabapentin (P =.006) during stabilization period 2. The median change in 4-week headache rate was statistically significant as well (P =.013). The most frequently reported adverse events for both treatment groups were asthenia, dizziness, somnolence, and infection. Adverse events determined by the investigator to be associated with study drug resulted in patient withdrawal in 13 (13.3%) of 98 gabapentin-treated patients and 3 (6.7%) of 45 placebo-treated patients. Somnolence and dizziness accounted for many of the premature withdrawals among those taking gabapentin. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin is an effective prophylactic agent for patients with migraine. In addition, gabapentin appears generally well tolerated with mild to moderate somnolence and dizziness.","Acetates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Analgesics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/*prevention & control, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

We describe two boys with static encephalopathy who experienced recurrent episodes of generalized, violent ballism seemingly provoked by relatively minor infectious illnesses or surgical procedures. These episodes first began at ages 14 and 9 years, respectively. The baseline clinical states included relatively mild choreoathetosis plus cognitive impairment, as well as spasticity and/or ataxia. These episodes of ballism developed over hours, remained for weeks, and ultimately returned to baseline. Neuroleptics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines were only partially beneficial; responses corresponded to the degree of sedation. Potential for self-injury or rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria led to the use of general anesthetics or neuromuscular blocking agents during selected episodes. Blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid studies, magnetic resonance imaging head scans, and electroencephalography revealed no diagnostic clues as to the precise causative factor precipitating these episodes.","Adolescent, Central Nervous System Agents/therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy, Child, Dyskinesias/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Male, Neurologic Examination, Treatment Outcome, *Violence",-1

During an initial sampling phase, the training drug conditions (placebo, 15 mg/70 kg buspirone, and 10 mg/70 kg diazepam) were identified to subjects by letter codes before oral drug administration. During a subsequent training phase, subjects earned money for correct drug identifications made two hours after drug administration. Ten out of 12 subjects acquired the three-response discrimination. When lower doses of buspirone (3.75 and 7.5 mg/70 kg) and diazepam (2.5 and 5.0 mg/70 kg) were tested in a subsequent generalization testing phase, both buspirone and diazepam produced dose-related increases in appropriate drug identifications, without significant cross-generalization. Analyses of standardized and unstructured self report questionnaires revealed that buspirone and diazepam produced different profiles of effects, and that buspirone was associated with a number of ""negative"" subject-rated effects including tension, nausea, and dizziness. These results demonstrate a distinct profile of discriminative stimulus and subjective effects for buspirone relative to diazepam which is consistent with its distinct pharmacological profile, and provide evidence for the sensitivity of the three-response drug discrimination procedure.","Adult, Affect/drug effects, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*pharmacology, Buspirone/*pharmacology, Diazepam/*pharmacology, *Discrimination (Psychology), Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Male",-1

The apparent rareness may be because of a lack of recognition of the syndrome or its predisposing factors. Fluoxetine (Prozac, Dista Products Co, Division of Eli Lilly Co, Indianapolis, IN), sertraline (Zoloft, Roerig Division, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY), and paroxetine (Paxil, SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) belong to a new class of antidepressant medication: the serotonin reuptake-inhibitors (SRIs). The relative safety profile of the SRIs has led to their widespread use. However, a syndrome of excessive serotonergic activity, the ""serotonin syndrome"" (SS), has recently been recognized. It is characterized by changes in mental status, hypertension, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis in these acutely ill patients. The most common agents implicated in SS are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors in combination with L-tryptophan or fluoxetine. A case of a patient with significant peripheral vascular disease who developed SS while taking paroxetine and an over-the-counter cold medicine is reported.

Some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with delirium, and digitalis toxicity has been shown to cause hallucinations, mania, euphoria, and depression.

Modern management emphasises the role of self-care, beginning in primary care with the first episode. Without root compression, bed rest should not exceed 48 hours. Emphasis is on encouraging a rapid return to physical fitness and other activities, including employment, acknowledging that returning to a normal life may require working through pain. Medication facilitates this.

METHODS: In a randomized double blind prospective dose finding study 40 patients undergoing transurethral prostatectomy with spinal anesthetic were allocated to receive 75 mg lidocaine 5% intrathecally as the sole agent (group A), or co-administered with 0.15 mg x kg(-1) meperidine (group B) or 0.30 mg x kg(-1) meperidine (group C). Sensory and motor blockade profiles were documented. Postoperatively, the amount of analgesics required, time to first analgesic, visual analogue scores and adverse events were recorded. RESULTS: Sensory blocks at or above T10 was maintained for 128, 156 and 145 minutes in groups A, B and C respectively. There was no difference in the latency or duration of the motor block among the three groups. Patients in group C had lower visual analogue pain scores (VAPS) over time than did those in groups A and B (P < 0.05). Time to first analgesia was longer (429 +/- 197 minutes) in group C than in group A (254 +/- 157 minutes) (P < 0.05). Fewer patients in group C required parenteral opioid postoperatively than in group A (P < 0.05). The incidence of bradycardia was higher in the groups receiving meperidine. No symptoms of transient radicular irritation (TRI) were reported in the groups receiving meperidine. CONCLUSION: The addition of 0.3 mg x kg(-1) of meperidine to spinal lidocaine prolongs postoperative analgesia without delaying discharge from post anesthetic care unit (Table II) and reduces the requirement for parenteral analgesics (Table III).","Adjuvants, Anesthesia/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Analgesia/*methods, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Analysis of Variance, Anesthesia, Spinal/methods, Anesthetics, Local/*administration & dosage, Arrhythmia, Sinus/chemically induced, Bradycardia/chemically induced, Double-Blind Method, Humans, Hypotension/chemically induced, Incidence, Lidocaine/*administration & dosage, Male, Meperidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Motor Neurons/drug effects, Nerve Block/methods, Neurons, Afferent/drug effects, Pain Measurement, Pain, Postoperative/*prevention & control, Prospective Studies, Prostatectomy, Time Factors",-1

To evaluate its possible role in anesthesia we assessed the sedative and sympatholytic effects of orally administered tizanidine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over study in six healthy male volunteers. Three different doses of tizanidine (4, 8, and 12 mg) were tested and compared to clonidine 150 micrograms. The sedative and sympatholytic effects of tizanidine 12 mg were comparable in magnitude to those of clonidine 150 micrograms, but the effects of clonidine were longer lasting. Similarly, the observed decreases in arterial blood pressure (diastolic, 13% and 19%; systolic, 10% and 8% for tizanidine and clonidine, respectively) and salivation were comparable in magnitude but of shorter duration after tizanidine 12 mg than after clonidine. Clonidine and tizanidine 12 mg had also similar effects on the secretion of growth hormone. Our results indicate that the effects of a single 12-mg oral dose of tizanidine resemble those of 150 micrograms oral clonidine, but are of shorter duration. Tizanidine may thus be a useful alternative to clonidine as an orally active, short-acting alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist in the perioperative period.","Administration, Oral, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/administration & dosage, Adult, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Clonidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives, Flicker Fusion/drug effects, Growth Hormone/blood, Humans, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage, Norepinephrine/blood, Salivation/drug effects",-1

Ultrafiltration was employed in the separation of unbound warfarin enantiomers. Twelve plasma samples from six stroke patients taking warfarin regularly were analyzed. The average concentration of total warfarin was 0.47 +/- 0.17 mg/L for the S-isomer and 0.69 +/- 0.18 mg/L for the R-isomer. The average protein binding was 99.67 +/- 0.33% for S-warfarin and 99.44 +/- 0.33% for R-warfarin. This methodology provides a quick and reliable technique for determining enantiomeric protein binding of warfarin in clinical settings.","Aged, Blood Proteins/*metabolism, Calibration, Cerebrovascular Disorders/*blood/drug therapy, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods, Fluorescence, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Protein Binding, Stereoisomerism, Warfarin/*blood/therapeutic use",-1

A case report is presented with a review of a 25-year experience at Mayo Clinic. We describe the case of a 65-year-old woman who presented with persistent hiccups, dyspnea, and pleurisy of 3 days duration that was caused by tetanus from inadequate secondary immunity. She required intubation for progressive trismus and laryngospasm-associated respiratory failure. Infusion of lorazepam did not control her spasms. Refractory spasms and hiccups resolved with fentanyl and cisatracurium therapy. After 3 weeks, the patient was weaned from the ventilator with complete recovery. In the past 25 years, nine additional patients have presented to Mayo Clinic with acute tetanus. Respiratory failure requiring intubation developed in seven patients, and six of the seven intubated patients survived with minimal deficits. The prognosis of tetanus is favorable if it is diagnosed promptly and if treatment and supportive measures are begun. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with acute tetanus presenting with hiccups. This report also confirms the results of previous studies that suggested a need for improved immunity in the elderly population.","Acute Disease, Aged, Combined Modality Therapy, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Respiration, Artificial, Respiratory Insufficiency/*etiology/*therapy, Risk Assessment, Severity of Illness Index, Tetanus/*complications/*diagnosis/therapy",-1
12187323,The clinical development of the bryostatins.,"Clamp A, Jayson GC",Anticancer Drugs. 2002 Aug;13(7):673-83.,"The bryostatins are a group of novel macrocyclic lactones derived from the marine bryozoan, Bugula neritina. In vitro evidence indicates that their main mechanism of action is modulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Phase I studies suggested significant antineoplastic activity against several tumor types and defined the main dose-limiting toxicity as myalgia. Bryostatin-1 has subsequently been investigated extensively in phase II clinical trials as a single agent, although trial design has been hampered by lack of human pharmacokinetic data. Results have been generally disappointing but in vitro and animal data suggests an important role for bryostatin-1 in combination with cytotoxic agents.

The medical literature since 1989 was reviewed. Although new drug trials hold promise to decrease impairment from MS, well-coordinated interdisciplinary care to minimize disability and handicap most profoundly affect the quality of life for patients with MS. MS is usually not severely disabling, and appropriately timed intervention can prevent secondary impairment and reduce disability and handicap. Pharmacologic, physical, and psychosocial issues--ranging from spasticity, pain, weakness, and tremor to neurogenic bowel management and sexuality--are addressed. General wellness measures remain important. The influence of the Americans With Disabilities Act is discussed, and specific adaptive equipment and social resources are outlined. The ultimate goals of management of patients with MS are functional independence and efficient use of medical and community resources: a focus on ""ability"" rather than ""disability.""

12801427,Restoring function after spinal cord injury.,"Becker D, Sadowsky CL, McDonald JW",Neurologist. 2003 Jan;9(1):1-15.,"BACKGROUND: By affecting young people during the most productive period of their lives, spinal cord injury is a devastating problem for modern society. A decade ago, treating SCI seemed frustrating and hopeless because of the tremendous morbidity and mortality, life-shattering impact, and limited therapeutic options associated with the condition. Today, however, an understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the development of neuroprotective interventions, and progress toward regenerative interventions are increasing hope for functional restoration. REVIEW SUMMARY: This study addresses the present understanding of SCI, including the etiology, pathophysiology, treatment, and scientific advances. The discussion of treatment options includes a critical review of high-dose methylprednisolone and GM-1 ganglioside therapy. The concept that limited rebuilding can provide a disproportionate improvement in quality of life is emphasized throughout. CONCLUSIONS: New surgical procedures, pharmacologic treatments, and functional neuromuscular stimulation methods have evolved over the last decades that can improve functional outcomes after spinal cord injury, but limiting secondary injury remains the primary goal. Tissue replacement strategies, including the use of embryonic stem cells, become an important tool and can restore function in animal models. Controlled clinical trials are now required to confirm these observations. The ultimate goal is to harness the body's own potential to replace lost central nervous system cells by activation of endogenous progenitor cell repair mechanisms.","Humans, Nerve Regeneration/physiology, Recovery of Function/*physiology, Spinal Cord Injuries/*etiology/*physiopathology/therapy",-1

Clinical manifestations relate to the area affected. Some of the conditions associated with cerebral palsy require surgical intervention. Problems during the peri-operative period may include hypothermia, nausea and vomiting and muscle spasm. Peri-operative seizure control, respiratory function and gastro-oesophageal reflux also require consideration. Intellectual disability is common and, in those affected, may range from mild to severe. These children should be handled with sensitivity as communication disorders and sensory deficits may mask mild or normal intellect. They should be accompanied by their carers at induction and in the recovery room as they usually know how best to communicate with them. Postoperative pain management and the prevention of muscle spasm is important and some of the drugs used in the management of spasm such as baclofen and botulinum toxin are discussed. Epidural analgesia is particularly valuable when major orthopaedic procedures are performed.","*Analgesia, *Anesthesia, *Cerebral Palsy, Child, Child, Preschool, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Pain/*prevention & control, Pain Measurement, Perioperative Care/methods, Postoperative Care/methods, Premedication, Preoperative Care/methods",-1
12615951,Topical and peripherally acting analgesics.,Sawynok J,Pharmacol Rev. 2003 Mar;55(1):1-20.,"Acute nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic pain all depend to some degree on the peripheral activation of primary sensory afferent neurons. The localized peripheral administration of drugs, such as by topical application, can potentially optimize drug concentrations at the site of origin of the pain, while leading to lower systemic levels and fewer adverse systemic effects, fewer drug interactions, and no need to titrate doses into a therapeutic range compared with systemic administration. Primary sensory afferent neurons can be activated by a range of inflammatory mediators such as prostanoids, bradykinin, ATP, histamine, and serotonin, and inhibiting their actions represents a strategy for the development of analgesics. Peripheral nerve endings also express a variety of inhibitory neuroreceptors such as opioid, alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, adenosine and cannabinoid receptors, and agonists for these receptors also represent viable targets for drug development. At present, topical and other forms of peripheral administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, capsaicin, local anesthetics, and alpha-adrenoceptor agonists are being used in a variety of clinical states. There also are some clinical data on the use of topical antidepressants and glutamate receptor antagonists. There are preclinical data supporting the potential for development of local formulations of adenosine agonists, cannabinoid agonists, cholinergic ligands, cytokine antagonists, bradykinin antagonists, ATP antagonists, biogenic amine antagonists, neuropeptide antagonists, and agents that alter the availability of nerve growth factor. Given that activation of sensory neurons involves multiple mediators, combinations of agents targeting different mechanisms may be particularly useful. Topical analgesics represent a promising area for future drug development.","Administration, Topical, *Analgesics/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Animals, Humans, Neurons, Afferent/drug effects/metabolism/physiology, Nociceptors/metabolism/physiology, *Pain/drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology, Peripheral Nervous System/*drug effects, Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology",-1

OBJECTIVE: To perform a randomized double-blind trial of diazepam, nitroglycerin, or both for treatment of patients with potential cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes. METHODS: Patients with potential cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes were randomized to treatment with either diazepam, nitroglycerin, or both every 5 minutes or until symptom resolution. Outcomes were chest pain resolution (measured by visual analog scale), and changes in blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac output (L/min), cardiac index (L/min/m2), stroke volume (mL/beat), and stroke index (mL/beat/m2) over the 15-minute treatment period. To adjust for seven outcomes using the Bonferroni correction, alpha was set at 0.007. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled (diazepam, 12; nitroglycerin, 13; both, 15). Patients had a mean age (+/-SD) of 35.4 (+/-7.5) years; 75% were male. They presented a mean of 5 hours and 37 minutes after cocaine use. Baseline demographics, cocaine use patterns, chest pain characteristics, and initial electrocardiograms were similar for all groups. Chest pain severity improved similarly in the three groups [-33.3 mm (+/-8.0); -30.7 mm (+/-7.1); -33.0 mm (+/-7.9); p = 0.6]. The stroke index decreased during the 15-minute treatment period for all groups (diazepam, -8.7 (+/-3.3); nitroglycerin, -3.1 +/- 2.8; both, -1.8 (+/-3.1) mL/beat/m2; p = 0.03). After adjustment for differences between baseline hemodynamic and cardiac profiles and multiple comparisons, there was no difference in any response to therapy over time for the different treatments. CONCLUSIONS: For treatment of patients with potential cocaine-associated acute coronary syndromes, chest pain resolutions and changes in cardiac performance are not different in patients treated with diazepam or nitroglycerin. In this study, the use of both agents did not offer any advantage over either agent alone.","Adult, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Cocaine-Related Disorders/*drug therapy, Coronary Disease/chemically induced/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Diazepam/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Therapy, Combination, Electrocardiography, Emergency Service, Hospital, Female, Hemodynamics/drug effects, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Nitroglycerin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Risk Factors, Vasodilator Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use",-1
11910268,The anxiolytic effect of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone compared with diazepam in subjects anxious before dental surgery.,"Wilner KD, Anziano RJ, Johnson AC, Miceli JJ, Fricke JR, Titus CK",J Clin Psychopharmacol. 2002 Apr;22(2):206-10.,"The novel atypical antipsychotic ziprasidone has a pharmacologic profile notable for potent agonism of serotonin (5-HT)1A receptors, antagonism at 5-HT1D receptors, and reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine. 5-HT1A receptor agonism, in particular, suggests anxiolytic activity, and ziprasidone has shown preliminary efficacy in treating the symptoms of anxiety associated with psychotic disorders. In this study, the anxiolytic efficacy of ziprasidone was evaluated in nonpsychotic subjects who were anxious before undergoing minor dental surgery. We compared a single oral dose of 20 mg ziprasidone (N = 30) with that of 10 mg diazepam (N = 30) and placebo (N = 30) in a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind study. The peak anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone compared with that of placebo was similar to that of diazepam but had a later onset. At 3 hours postdose, the anxiolytic effect of ziprasidone was significantly greater than that of placebo (p < 0.05) and somewhat greater than that of diazepam. Diazepam showed a significantly greater anxiolytic effect than placebo at 1 hour (p < 0.05) but not at 3 hours. The sedative effect of ziprasidone was never greater than that of placebo, whereas that of diazepam was significantly greater than that of placebo 1 to 1.5 hours postdose. Ziprasidone was generally well tolerated. Only one patient reported treatment-related adverse events (nausea and vomiting) and, unlike diazepam, ziprasidone did not cause reductions in blood pressure. Dystonia, extrapyramidal syndrome, akathisia, and postural hypotension were not seen with ziprasidone. Thus, ziprasidone may possess anxiolytic effects in addition to its antipsychotic properties.","Adolescent, Adult, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Antipsychotic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Arousal/drug effects, Dental Anxiety/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology, Diazepam/*adverse effects, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Premedication, Thiazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Treatment Outcome",-1

For the successful use of these drugs or procedures, the treating physician must be familiar and comfortable with the drugs' mode of action and consider some important principles: 1. The diagnosis must be secure before starting therapy. 2. It is essential to have a basic understanding of the immunologic dysfunction that is amenable to immunotherapy. 3. The goals and the expectations of therapy must be defined, and the risk/benefit ratio of the drugs or procedures must be well understood. 4. Improvement must be based on objective measurements of muscle strength and a beneficial change in activities of daily living, and not solely on a change in the laboratory test values. 5. The limitations of therapy and the time suitable for starting or stopping a drug should be clear to both the therapist and the patient. 6. The selection of a drug or procedure should be guided on the basis of current knowledge, preferably established in controlled trials. 7. Every effort must be made to prevent the development of adverse effects and to determine the lowest dose of a medication that controls the disease. 8. Drug interactions that can cause adverse effects and conditions that can worsen a disease must be avoided.","Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy, Drug Interactions, Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use, Nervous System Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology, *Neuroimmunomodulation",-1

It is a chronic neuropathic pain syndrome and remains one of the most difficult pain disorders to treat. Known beneficial agents include antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, opioid analgesics, local anaesthetics, capsaicin and other, less applied, modalities. Although monotherapy is commonly applied, no single best treatment for postherpetic neuralgia has been identified; nevertheless, gabapentin (antiepileptic) and transdermal lidocaine (anaesthetic) are often used as the first-choice treatments. Recent research has shed light on possible pain mechanisms as well as new avenues of treatment, which are discussed in the article. For patients with pain that is not adequately controlled, individualised treatment plans must be pursued. It is critical to recognise that postherpetic neuralgia, while difficult to manage, can be a treatable neuropathic pain syndrome.","Analgesics/therapeutic use, Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Herpes Zoster/*complications, Humans, Neuralgia/*drug therapy/etiology",-1

A new therapeutic strategy.,"Manolis AJ, Olympios C, Sifaki M, Handanis S, Bresnahan M, Gavras I, Gavras H",Hypertension. 1995 Nov;26(5):719-24.,"Neurohormonal activation with increased plasma renin activity and norepinephrine and vasopressin levels is characteristic of congestive heart failure and contributes to further decompensation and poor prognosis. We treated 20 such patients with the centrally acting sympathoinhibitory drug clonidine 0.15 mg BID and obtained hemodynamic measurements by cardiac catheterization and plasma neurohormone levels before and 2 to 3 hours after the first dose; in 7 patients, these measurements were taken again after 1 week of therapy. The initial dose produced significant decreases of 8% in mean arterial pressure, 23% in right atrial pressure, 21% in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 19% in mean pulmonary artery pressure, and 12% in heart rate, a 17% increase in stroke volume; and no significant changes in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. All changes remained virtually constant after 1 week. Plasma norepinephrine decreased by 28% after the initial dose and 62% after 1 week (P < 0.1), whereas plasma renin activity remained essentially unchanged. Plasma vasopressin tended to increase, its levels being inversely correlated with those of posttreatment norepinephrine (r = -.48 P < .03). Patients with baseline norepinephrine levels > 0.400 ng/mL has significantly poorer baseline hemodynamic parameters and tended to show more improvement with clonidine, although their data remained significantly worse than patients whose baseline norepinephrine was within the normal range. Sympathetic suppression with clonidine in congestive heart failure reduces preload, heart rate, and arterial pressure, all indexes of myocardial energy demand; the lack of significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance and increase in cardiac output might be attributable in part to enhanced release of vasopressin.2+ f2p4","Administration, Oral, Adult, Aged, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Female, Heart Failure/*drug therapy/*physiopathology, Hemodynamics/drug effects, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Norepinephrine/blood, Pilot Projects, Renin/blood, Sympathetic Nervous System/*drug effects/physiopathology, Sympatholytics/*therapeutic use, Vasopressins/blood",-1

We hypothesized that baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, would be an effective treatment in the symptomatic management of veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Fourteen male veterans with chronic, combat-related PTSD were enrolled in an open-label, 8-week, monotherapy trial of baclofen titrated to a maximum of 80 mg/d in 3 divided doses. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), and secondary outcome measures included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, and the Clinical Global Impressions. RESULTS: In the 11 patients who completed the 8-week trial, the mean total CAPS score decreased significantly from baseline (from 82.9 +/- 16.1 to 63.5 +/- 21.2). The avoidance and hyperarousal subscales showed significant decreases (from 36.2 +/- 6.2 to 26.5 +/- 9.6 and from 31.9 +/- 6.5 to 22.1 +/- 7.1, respectively), whereas the re-experiencing subscale remained unchanged. Significant improvements were also noted on all secondary outcome measures. Treatment response was noted within the first 4 weeks of treatment and was maintained throughout the trial. Baclofen therapy was well tolerated, as only 1 patient dropped out due to adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen therapy was effective in treating both the PTSD symptoms and accompanying depression and anxiety in patients with chronic PTSD due to combat.

We describe a patient with tonic extension of the left limbs caused by a right-sided brainstem lesion as the first manifestation of demyelinating disease. A 19-year-old man was referred with a 4-month history of spontaneous attacks of mild paresthesias of the left arm and leg, followed by 15-45 s of rigid extension of the left limbs, occurring up to 25 times per day. Two months after onset, an MRI scan revealed areas of T2 abnormality in the lateral right cerebral peduncle and deep frontal white matter. The EEG was normal, including during hyperventilation which induced a typical episode. All attacks were successfully suppressed by carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproate monotherapy. Serologic testing for toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands were absent but cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin G was mildly elevated (4.2 mg/dl). Over the next 30 months, serial MRIs revealed a normal spinal cord and persistence of the midbrain lesion, with resolution of some of the white matter lesions but reappearance of others. At 46 months, the midbrain lesion resolved on MRI, and the spasms no longer occurred spontaneously, nor could they be elicited by hyperventilation.

11060714,Zaleplon - a review of a novel sedative hypnotic used in the treatment of insomnia.,Heydorn WE,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2000 Apr;9(4):841-58.,"Zaleplon (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidin-7-yl) phenyl]-N-ethyl acetamide) is a non-benzodiazepine recently introduced for clinical use. This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam.","Acetamides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Pyrimidines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Seizures/drug therapy, Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/*drug therapy",-1

Its effect on the ambulatory status of individuals with cerebral spasticity, however, has not previously been addressed. We reviewed the effect of ITB on functional ambulation in 24 patients who were ambulatory to some extent, either with or without assistive devices. Twenty-one pumps were placed in patients with spastic cerebral palsy and 3 in patients with spasticity secondary to traumatic brain injury (13 boys and 11 girls, mean age 18 years). The mean ITB dose was 200 microg/day (range 22-550 microg/day) and the mean length of follow-up was 52 months. Ambulation was retrospectively graded on four functional levels: community, household, non-functional, and non-ambulatory. The level of ambulation improved by one functional level in 9 patients, did not change for 12 patients, and was worse in 3 patients. Gait was considered to be improved in 20 of 24 patients by the patients or their families. The overall functional improvement not directly related to ambulation was found to be improved in 20 patients, unchanged in 2 patients, and worse in 2 patients. ITB allows for improved ambulation in a certain subset of patients with lower extremity spasticity. It is not contraindicated in patients who rely upon their spasticity for support during ambulation. ITB infusion allows for baclofen dosage titration to balance between extensor tone for support and suppression of hyperactive reflexes which may impede normal locomotion.","Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/pharmacology, Brain Injuries/complications, Cerebral Palsy/complications/physiopathology, Child, Crutches, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Gait/drug effects, Humans, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable/adverse effects, Locomotion/*drug effects, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology, Patient Selection, Wheelchairs",-1
11826632,Common emergent pediatric neurologic problems.,"Reuter D, Brownstein D",Emerg Med Clin North Am. 2002 Feb;20(1):155-76.,"Although there are a variety of neurologic disease processes that the emergency physician should be aware of the most common of these include seizures, closed head injury, headache, and syncope. When one is evaluating a patient who has had a seizure, differentiating between febrile seizures, afebrile seizures, and SE helps to determine the extent of the work-up. Febrile seizures are typically benign, although a diagnosis of meningitis must not be missed. Educating parents regarding the likelihood of future seizures, and precautions to be taken should a subsequent seizure be witnessed, is important. The etiology of a first-time afebrile seizure varies with the patient's age at presentation, and this age-specific differential drives the diagnostic work-up. A follow-up EEG is often indicated, and imaging studies can appropriate on a nonurgent basis. Appropriate management of SE requires a paradigm of escalating pharmacologic therapy, and early consideration of transport for pediatric intensive care services if the seizure cannot be controlled with conventional three-tiered therapy. Closed head injury frequently is seen in the pediatric emergency care setting. The absence of specific clinical criteria to guide the need for imaging makes management of these children more difficult. A thorough history and physical examination is important to uncover risk factors that prompt emergent imaging. Headaches are best approached by assessing the temporal course, associated symptoms, and the presence of persistent neurologic signs. Most patients ultimately are diagnosed with either a tension or migraine headache; however, in those patients with a chronic progressive headache course, an intracranial process must be addressed and pursued with appropriate imaging. Syncope has multiple causes but can generally be categorized as autonomic, cardiac, or noncardiac. Although vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope, vigilance is required to identify those patients with a potentially fatal arrhythmia or with heart disease that predisposes to hypoperfusion. As such, all patients who present with syncope should have an ECG. Additional work-up studies are guided by the results of individual history and physical examination.","Adolescent, Child, Child, Preschool, Emergency Medicine/*methods, Head Injuries, Closed/diagnosis, Headache/diagnosis/therapy, Humans, Infant, Nervous System Diseases/*diagnosis/therapy, Seizures/diagnosis/therapy, Status Epilepticus/diagnosis/therapy, Syncope/diagnosis",-1

Problems such as severe contracture, joint deformity, and scoliosis interfere with the basic requirement of comfortable seating in children with quadriplegic involvement and frequently require surgery. In ambulatory children, the use of three-dimensional gait analysis has allowed multilevel surgery to be appropriately planned, minimizing exposure to surgery and therapy.","Cerebral Palsy/diagnosis/*therapy, Hemiplegia/rehabilitation, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Orthopedics, Paraplegia/rehabilitation, Patient Care Team",-1
12390637,"Health resource utilization of the emergency department headache ""repeater"".",Maizels M,Headache. 2002 Sep;42(8):747-53.,"OBJECTIVE: To document the health resource utilization of patients who repeatedly use emergency department services for headache care. BACKGROUND: Patients with headache who frequently use emergency department services may differ from patients with more typical, episodic migraine. Previous studies of health resource utilization have often failed to distinguish the high utilizer as a specific subset of the migraine population. DESIGN: Retrospective review of urgent care/emergency department charts, clinic charts, and pharmacy rosters. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who made three or more visits for headache to an urgent care/emergency department (UC/ED) facility for headache over a 6-month study period were identified and designated as ""repeaters"" for this study. Pharmacy profiles and appointment histories of 52 of the 54 repeaters whose records were available were reviewed for the 12 months prior to the study period. RESULTS: Over the 6-month study period, 518 patients visited the UC/ED 1004 times for primary headache complaints. Fifty-four (10%) repeaters made 502 visits (50% of total visits; mean 9.3, range 3-50). In the 12 months prior to the study period, 52 of these repeaters made 1832 visits to the UC/ED or clinic (mean 35.2, range 0-178): 1458 (79.6%) were headache related, and 1271 (69.4%) of all visits were to the UC/ED. An estimated 12-month cost for all visits was $183,760. Pharmacy rosters showed use of narcotics in 41 of the 52 patients (annual mean +/- SD, 613 +/- 670 tablets), benzodiazepines in 30 patients (500 +/- 486 tablets), and butalbital products in 27 patients (395 +/- 590 tablets). Mean daily use of all symptomatic medications combined was 3.9 +/- 3.2 doses/day. CONCLUSION: Health resource utilization of emergency department headache repeaters is predominantly headache-related acute care. Associated medication overuse is frequently present. Efforts to improve care for patients with headache will benefit from distinguishing the high utilizer as a subset of the migraine population.","Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Benzodiazepines, Chronic Disease, Emergency Service, Hospital/*utilization, Headache Disorders/chemically induced/*therapy, Health Resources/*utilization, Humans, Migraine Disorders/*therapy, Narcotics/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies",-1

METHODS: Fifty-five women with previously diagnosed fibromyalgia were monitored for daily pain (VAS) in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. One group received relaxation training and guided instruction in ""pleasant imagery"" (PI) in order to distract from the pain experience (n=17). Another group received relaxation training and attention imagery upon the ""active workings of the internal pain control systems"", ""attention imagery"" (AI) (n=21). The control group (CG) received treatment as usual (n=17). Patients were also randomly assigned to 50-mg amitriptyline/day or placebo. Some psychological and socio-demographic variables were also measured initially. The slopes of diary pain ratings over a 4-week period were used as the outcome measures. RESULTS: We found significant differences of the pain-slopes between the three psychological conditions (P=0.0001). The pleasant imagery (P<0.005), but not the attention imagery group's slope, declined significantly when compared with the control group (P>0.05). There was neither a difference between the amitriptyline and placebo slopes (main effects, P=0.98) nor a significant amitriptyline x psychological interaction (P=0.76).

8309812,Psychopharmacology of disorders in children.,Sylvester C,Psychiatr Clin North Am. 1993 Dec;16(4):779-91.,"Several features of pediatric pharmacology applied to psychiatry were mentioned throughout this review. The use of medications in young children requires attention to nuances of informed consent because of limited data and many potentially beneficial, possibly safer medications that are not approved for children. Children more rapidly metabolize and eliminate medications. They differ in sensitivity to main effects and side effects of a variety of medications. Therefore, it is important to start low and aim for the lowest effective dose. Ultimate doses may be higher, split and frequent doses may be necessary, and both clinical and laboratory follow-up may need to be more frequent. Finally, childhood onset of psychiatric disorders, similar to pediatric experience with diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis, frequently confers devastating stress and chronicity. The child's physician shares the frustration of poor treatment response or responses that cannot be sustained in a developing, dependent organism with a more aggressive variant of a disorder and an inevitably longer course. Despite a heartening increase in pediatric psychopharmacology interest and knowledge, much remains to be learned.","Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy/psychology, Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity/drug therapy/psychology, Child, Child Behavior Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Child Development Disorders, Pervasive/drug therapy/psychology, Clinical Trials as Topic, Depressive Disorder/drug therapy/psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Mental Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Schizophrenia, Childhood/drug therapy/psychology",-1

A dense multiple sclerotic lesion in the spinal cord at or above the sixth thoracic level can cause interruption of descending inhibitory impulses and thus result in AD. A patient with MS presented to our facility with classic signs and symptoms of AD. We believe that lack of knowledge about the risks for this condition in MS led to a delay in diagnosis. METHODS: Case report illustrates AD in a person with MS. A convenience survey was conducted among clinicians who provide care to people with MS. The survey looked at both awareness of, and experience with, AD in MS. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of the respondents indicated they were not aware of the potential risk for AD among MS patients. Only 10% indicated they were aware of MS patients in their practice who had experienced AD. CONCLUSION: Although AD is probably less common in MS than in SCI, this case does not appear to be unique. Knowledge of this potential life-threatening complication of MS seems to be limited.","Autonomic Dysreflexia/*diagnosis/*etiology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Time Factors",-1

Current treatment options for urinary and sexual dysfunction are reviewed. As most urogenital symptoms of MS can now be treated by conservative means, expert urological or gynaecological consultation should be requested only if more aggressive diagnostic or therapeutic measures are needed.","Autonomic Nervous System/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Central Nervous System/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology, Erectile Dysfunction/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Female, Genitalia/drug effects/innervation/physiopathology, Humans, Male, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Neural Pathways/drug effects/pathology/physiopathology, Urinary Bladder/drug effects/innervation/physiopathology, Urinary Bladder, Neurogenic/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology",-1
12374576,Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome).,Gordon N,Eur J Paediatr Neurol. 2002;6(5):243-7.,"The arguments over the nomenclature of the syndrome are reviewed. Ethical considerations favour replacing the present eponyms with the title of panthothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), now that more is known about the cause of the condition. The symptoms and signs of the syndrome are described, and these can present from infancy to adult life. Dystonia, involuntary movements and spasticity are prominent causes of disability. If the onset is delayed the presentation can be unusual. Tests that can help in diagnosis are reviewed, especially the ""eye of the tiger"" revealed by magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Death usually occurs about 10 years after the onset, but the course may be more prolonged. The findings on autopsy are also considered, with the typical findings of iron pigment deposits and axonal spheroids. Then the causes are discussed. Once the responsible gene PANK2 had been discovered on chromosome 20 it was found that this encoded for pantothenate kinase which is essential for the synthesis of coenzyme A from pantothenate; and this is integral to fatty acid synthesis and energy metabolism. Also this can lead to a concentration of cysteine in the basal ganglia, and then to an accumulation of iron in these areas. The cysteine-iron complex will result in tissue damage by promoting oxidative stress, as in some other neurodegenerative diseases. The syndrome of PKAN can therefore be identified as a disorder of pantothanate, vitamin B5, metabolism. Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy is briefly described as there have been suggestions that it is a variety of PKAN, but the evidence is in favour of the two diseases being separate entities. There may as yet be no specific treatment for this syndrome, but much can be done to help these children. Drugs may be needed to control epilepsy, and when dystonia is severe it may be possible to alleviate this by medical or surgical means. Also there will be other problems needing expert management, such as the provision of alternative means of communication if dysarthria is marked. The hope for the future is that now the cause has been found it will be possible to use methods such as antioxidative therapy and gene induction procedures.","Adolescent, Adult, Basal Ganglia/pathology, Child, Child, Preschool, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20, Humans, Infant, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Mutation/*genetics, Neurologic Examination, Pantothenate Kinase-Associated Neurodegeneration/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy, Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*genetics",-1

The objective of the study was to determine the usefulness of mefloquine (MQ) (despite the delay in starting) and its tolerability in this group. METHODS: Ninety-one workers (89 males, 2 females) were commenced on weekly MQ 250 mg doses for 17 weeks. Most of the subjects were followed up to 16 weeks after cessation of chemoprophylaxis. The morbidity pattern before, during, and after cessation of chemoprophylaxis was compared. RESULTS: Of the 91 workers included in the study, 89 were evaluable. Three (3.37%) of these developed clinical illness during the 17-week period of chemoprophylaxis. This protection was highly significant when compared to 23 of 91 people (25.27%) who developed clinical illness before chemoprophylaxis was commenced (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.43, p <.001). The risk of developing acute malaria increased more than three times, among 84 members of the group who were followed up to 16 weeks after MQ was discontinued (RR 3.18, 95% CI 0.89-11.34). Two subjects withdrew after the second dose due to adverse reactions, however the remaining 89 subjects tolerated the drug for the 16-week period.

""I can't exercise; I hurt too much to exercise; and, I don't have enough energy to exercise"" are equally common responses from patients with FM. Such exchanges can lead to frustration for both patient and provider. The factor that neither participant in the dialogue is addressing is that exercise carries both risks and benefits for persons with FM. Although for decades exercise has been acknowledged to be a key component of the treatment of FM, the majority of FM patients remain aerobically unfit, with poor muscle strength and limited flexibility. Unfit muscle is theoretically more prone to muscle microtrauma, which causes localized pain and may trigger widespread pain through disordered central processing. The purpose of this article is to provide practicing health care providers with guidelines for prescribing exercise to FM patients that take into account the risk/benefit ratio. A sample exercise prescription is included.","*Exercise Therapy, Fibromyalgia/*therapy, Humans, Practice Guidelines as Topic",-1

11219477,Sildenafil citrate: a therapeutic update.,"Boyce EG, Umland EM",Clin Ther. 2001 Jan;23(1):2-23.,"BACKGROUND: Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration in March 1998, sildenafil citrate has been used by millions of men for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Recent studies and consensus reports have expanded our understanding of its efficacy, safety, contraindications, and drug interactions. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews recent studies of the efficacy of sildenafil, its adverse effects and drug interactions, and socioeconomic factors involved in its use, with a focus on specific patient populations (prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, spinal cord injuries, neurologic disorders). METHODS: Clinical studies, case reports, and commentaries and editorials concerning sildenafil published in the international literature between January 1999 and August 2000 were identified through searches of MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, using the terms sildenafil, Viagra, and erectile dysfunction. RESULTS: Sildenafil has demonstrated effectiveness in men with erectile dysfunction associated with prostatectomy, radiation therapy, diabetes mellitus, certain neurologic disorders, and drug therapy (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). It has not been as effective in women with sexual dysfunction, with the exception of SSRI-associated sexual dysfunction. Some disorders unrelated to sexual dysfunction (eg, esophageal motility dysfunction) may also respond to sildenafil. In the general population, sildenafil is considered to have an acceptable tolerability profile; however, patients with moderate to severe cardiovascular disease or those taking nitrate therapy are at increased risk for potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects with sildenafil therapy. In addition, patients taking drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 isozyme, which metabolizes sildenafil, may experience increased drug concentrations and possible toxicity from normal doses of sildenafil. CONCLUSIONS: Sildenafil is an effective first-line therapy for erectile dysfunction in men. The decision to prescribe this agent should include such considerations as the cost-risk-benefit balance, patient access, drug distribution pathways, and prescription drug coverage.","Drug Interactions, Erectile Dysfunction/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Male, Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Purines, Sulfones",-1
12122923,Management of sleep disorders in fibromyalgia.,Moldofsky H,Rheum Dis Clin North Am. 2002 May;28(2):353-65.,"In summary, the treatment of patients with FM requires a proper assessment of the reason for the unrefreshing sleep, which is an important component of the FM syndrome. Sleep laboratory investigations provides a suitable rationale for management where a specific primary sleep disorder is determined. Nonspecific treatments include various behavioral approaches to improve sleep hygiene, fitness, and regular proper nutrition that serve to regularize disturbances in circadian sleep-wake rhythms. As yet, no medication is known to improve the EEG sleep arousal disorders that include phasic (alpha-delta), tonic alpha non-REM sleep disorders, or the periodic K alpha cycling alternating pattern disorder. Traditional hypnotic agents, while helpful in initiating and maintaining sleep and reducing daytime tiredness, do not provide restorative sleep or reduce pain. Tricyclic drugs, such as amitriptyline and cyclobenzaprine, may provide long term benefit for improving sleep but may not have a continuing benefit beyond one month for reducing pain. The use of a biologic agent that facilitates sleep-related neuroendocrine functions, for example growth hormone, is reported to improve symptoms but the need for injection and high cost restrict its use.

12122924,Treatment of fatigue in fibromyalgia.,"Guymer EK, Clauw DJ",Rheum Dis Clin North Am. 2002 May;28(2):367-78.,"Clearly, fatigue is a large and challenging problem for those suffering from fibromyalgia. It adds greatly to the morbidity and disability associated with the disease. In the management of this specific symptom in fibromyalgia, attention should first be focused on identifying comorbidities that may be present and contribute to fatigue. As with other symptoms of fibromyalgia, education is a critical component of management. This can be done by the practitioner, with available free resources, or with specialized cognitive behavioral programs. This education process can be augmented with a variety of other nonpharmacologic therapies, especially very gradually increasing, low-impact, aerobic exercise programs. Numerous pharmacologic therapies may also be helpful as an adjunct to treatment. Classes of compounds that raise central levels of norepinephrine or dopamine appear to be the most specific for management of fatigue. There are also many medications used to combat fatigue in other disorders that have not yet been adequately explored as to the possible benefits in alleviating the fatigue of fibromyalgia. Advances in the management of fatigue in fibromyalgia are likely to come from a variety of directions. Easier access to well designed nonpharmacologic therapies is essential, because these treatments are underutilized in clinical practice at present. Improvements in pharmacologic therapies will come from new insights into mechanisms, especially those that might only be present in subsets of patients and would respond to more targeted therapies.","Fatigue/*etiology/*therapy, Fibromyalgia/*complications, Humans",-1

10328249,Functional MRI-BOLD of visually triggered headache in patients with migraine.,"Cao Y, Welch KM, Aurora S, Vikingstad EM",Arch Neurol. 1999 May;56(5):548-54.,"BACKGROUND: Spreading depression of Leao has been hypothesized as the basis for the visual aura of the migraine attack, supported by cerebral blood flow measurements of spreading hypoperfusion. The early depolarizing or activation phase of experimental spreading depression, however, is associated with a transient but pronounced cerebral blood flow increase that precedes spreading hypoperfusion. OBJECTIVE: To study this early phase of the migraine attack, we investigated visually triggered attacks of headache and visual symptoms using a red-green checkerboard stimulus in patients with migraine. INTERVENTIONS: We studied occipital cortex activation during visual stimulation by measuring occipital cortex perfusion with functional magnetic resonance imaging-blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast in 10 patients with migraine with aura and 2 patients with migraine without aura and 6 healthy subjects. RESULTS: In 6 patients with migraine with aura and 2 patients with migraine without aura, their typical headache with (n = 2) or without visual change was visually triggered at 7.3 minutes (mean time) after visual stimulation began. In 5 of these patients, the onset of headache or visual change, or both, was preceded by suppression of initial activation (mean onset time, 4.3 minutes; P<.001) The suppression slowly propagated into contiguous occipital cortex at a rate ranging from 3 to 6 mm/ min. This neuronal suppression was accompanied by baseline contrast intensity increases that indicated vasodilatation and tissue hyperoxygenation. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that visually triggered headache and visual change in patients with migraine is accompanied by spreading suppression of initial neuronal activation and increased occipital cortex oxygenation. We postulate that this spreading suppression may be associated with initial activation of a migraine attack, independent of whether there are associated aura symptoms. We further postulate that there may be an association between vasodilation accompanying the initial stage of suppression and the induction of headache.","Adult, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Migraine Disorders/*physiopathology, Neurons, Afferent/physiology, Occipital Lobe/*blood supply/pathology, Oxygen/blood, Regional Blood Flow, Visual Perception/*physiology",-1
10471245,Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors: an update.,"Masand PS, Gupta S",Harv Rev Psychiatry. 1999 Jul-Aug;7(2):69-84.,"Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and citalopram, represent an important advance in the pharmacotherapy of mood and other disorders. They are chemically unrelated to tricyclic, heterocyclic, and other first-generation antidepressants. SSRIs are the treatment of choice for many indications, including major depression, dysthymia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, because of their efficacy, good side-effect profile, tolerability, and safety in overdose, as well as patient compliance. A review of the literature was conducted using Medline and the terms ""SSRIs,"" ""fluoxetine,"" ""sertraline,"" ""paroxetine,"" ""fluvoxamine,"" and ""citalopram."" Articles were limited to those published in English within the last 15 years. The search revealed that indications for antidepressants include unipolar depression, dysthymia, bipolar depression, treatment-resistant depression, depression in the medically ill, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, eating disorders, social phobia, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. One SSRI, fluoxetine, has demonstrated safety in pregnancy. Side effects of SSRIs include gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, sedation, insomnia, activation, weight gain, impaired memory, excessive perspiration, paresthesia, and sexual dysfunction.","Depressive Disorder/drug therapy, Drug Interactions, Eating Disorders/drug therapy, Female, Humans, Lactation/drug effects, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/drug therapy, Panic Disorder/drug therapy, Phobic Disorders/drug therapy, Pregnancy, Premenstrual Syndrome/drug therapy, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use",-1

Twenty-two patients (39%) underwent monotherapy; the rest received additional psychotropic drugs. Doses were given once daily in the evening, and serum olanzapine levels were measured 12 hours later. For the whole group, the concentration-to-dose ratio (C/D) varied 26-fold, with a median value of 4.8 (nmol/L)/(mg/24 hours), but 80% of the patients had C/D values within the range 2 to 10 (nmol/L)/(mg/24 hours). All but three patients received standard doses (5-20 mg/24 hours), of whom 80% had serum concentrations of olanzapine within the range 22 to 146 nmol/L. Patients comedicated with potential inhibitors of CYP2D6 and other drugs displayed a median C/D approximately 40% higher than the group undergoing monotherapy. Patients comedicated with carbamazepine had a median C/D 36% lower than that of the monotherapy group. Therefore, the serum concentration range (12-hour values) of 25 to 150 nmol/L can be expected for patients receiving a standard daily dose.","Adolescent, Adult, Antipsychotic Agents/*blood/pharmacokinetics, Benzodiazepines, Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/antagonists & inhibitors, Drug Interactions, *Drug Monitoring, Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pirenzepine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics, Psychotic Disorders/*blood/metabolism",-1

Although this medication combination is widely used in clinical practice, there is no well-tested, optimal method of coadministering these medications for the treatment of panic disorder. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of early coadministration of clonazepam with sertraline in the treatment of panic disorder. METHODS: Fifty patients with panic disorder were randomized into a double-blind clinical trial. Patients received open-label sertraline for 12 weeks (target dose, 100 mg/d), and in addition were randomized to groups receiving either 0.5 mg of active clonazepam 3 times daily or placebo clonazepam for the first 4 weeks of the trial. The clonazepam dose was then tapered during 3 weeks and discontinued. RESULTS: Thirty-four (68%) of 50 patients completed the trial. Drop-out rates were similar in the sertraline/placebo vs the sertraline/clonazepam group (38% vs 25%) (P =.5). An intent-to-treat analysis (on last observation carried forward data) revealed a much greater proportion of responders in the sertraline/clonazepam compared with the sertraline/placebo group at the end of week 1 of the trial (41% vs 4%) (P =.003). There was also a significant between-group difference at the end of week 3 with 14 (63%) of 22 of the sertraline/clonazepam group responding to treatment vs 8 (32%) of 25 of the sertraline/placebo group (P =.05). This difference was not observed at other times during the trial. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that rapid stabilization of panic symptoms can be safely achieved with a sertraline/clonazepam combination, supporting the clinical utility of this type of regimen for facilitating early improvement of panic symptoms relative to sertraline alone.","Adult, Anticonvulsants, Clonazepam/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Humans, Male, Panic Disorder/diagnosis/*drug therapy/psychology, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Sertraline/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

The uncontrolled clinical surveillance study included 16944 outpatients with subjective difficulties in initiating and/or maintaining sleep. Office-based neurologists, psychiatrists, internists and general practitioners were asked individually to adjust the dosage of zolpidem (age < or = 65 years, 10-20 mg; age > 65 years, 5-10 mg) over a recommended period of 3-4 weeks. In total, 82.8% of patients completed the survey (36% men, 64% women, mean age 58.8 +/- 14.9 years; 58.6% without previous hypnotic medication; duration of sleep complaints > 6 months in 40.6%, 1-6 months in 27.8%). Most patients (63.9%) took zolpidem on a daily basis. The average dose was 10 mg zolpidem per night in 74.8%, 5 mg in 19.8%, 20 mg in 2.4% and > 20 mg in 10 cases. Most physicians (87.6%) rated the efficacy of zolpidem as 'very good' or 'good'. One hundred and eighty-two (1.1%) of the 16 944 patients reported 268 adverse events (one adverse event in 113 cases, two adverse events in 53 cases and more than two adverse events in 16 cases). One hundred and eighteen (64.8%) of these patients (0.006% of all participating patients) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Nausea (n = 36), dizziness (n = 35), malaise (n = 23), nightmares (n = 20), agitation (n = 19), and headache (n = 18) were the most common adverse events. There was one serious adverse reaction in a 48-year-old women who developed paranoid symptoms during the documentation phase. No life-threatening adverse event occurred.

Recent case reports and studies have suggested potential efficacy in other neuropathic and nonneuropathic pain conditions. Several pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated minimal systemic absorption with 12-, 18-, and 24-hour/day dosing. Mean maximum plasma concentrations have shown the lidocaine patch to possess a minimal risk for systemic toxicities or drug-drug interactions. The most common adverse events generally involve mild skin reactions. There have been no drug-drug interactions noted in clinical trials. Recent evidence suggests that extended application does not result in A-beta-mediated sensory loss at the application site, which is particularly important in patients who already have a degree of sensory loss due to their underlying condition. The lidocaine patch provides a treatment option that carries a relatively low systemic adverse event and drug-drug interaction risk burden, even with continuous application of up to four patches per day.","Administration, Cutaneous, Aged, *Analgesia, Area Under Curve, Biological Availability, Clinical Trials as Topic, Erythema/chemically induced, Female, Humans, *Lidocaine/adverse effects/blood/pharmacokinetics, Male, Middle Aged",-1

Although the disease is more common in postmenopausal Caucasian women, all ages and races are at risk. Osteoporosis can be a debilitating disease that can cause pain, fractures, depression, and social withdrawal. Signs of osteoporosis include kyphosis, loss of height, and protrusion of the abdomen. Because symptoms generally do not occur until after the disease has progressed, clinicians should include osteoporosis screening and preventative education as part of the regular gynecologic care. Diagnosis is typically made by a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. Treatment consists of dietary and lifestyle changes, along with pharmacologic intervention. Although hormone therapy has been shown to be effective in preventing osteoporosis, the risks of long-term treatment with HRT are discussed. The following effective treatment options for women who have been diagnosed with the disease are discussed: bisphosphonates, calcitonin, and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).

Failure on a particular test was defined as a score below the 5th percentile for healthy controls, and the number of patients who failed at least one or two tests (out of four) was determined for each battery. Both the SEFCI and the NPSBMS identified significantly more patients with impairment than the RBANS, which was no more sensitive than the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). Results were similar at both the one- and two-failed-tests criteria, but there were no significant differences between the SEFCI and the NPSBMS at either failure criterion. Mean administration time was 22.6 min for the SEFCI compared to 31.7 min for the NPSBMS (p < 0.001). Eleven (17%) of the patients refused to attempt the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), one component of the NPSBMS.

Because the clearance of gabapentin is dependent on renal function, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin were investigated in anuric subjects maintained on hemodialysis. Plasma samples were obtained over an 8-day period after administration of single oral 400-mg doses of gabapentin. Pre- and post-dialyzer plasma samples and dialysate samples from quantitative collection of dialyzer effluent were obtained during hemodialysis sessions performed 2, 4, and 7 days after dosing. A mean (SD) maximum gabapentin plasma concentration of 6.0 (2.4) micrograms/mL was achieved at 4.7 (2.1) hours post-dose. The elimination half-life of gabapentin on non-hemodialysis days averaged 132 hours. Approximately 35% of the gabapentin dose was recovered in dialysate, and mean hemodialysis clearance of gabapentin was 142 (26) mL/min; approximately 93% of the dialyzer creatinine clearance. Gabapentin elimination half-life during hemodialysis was approximately 4 hours. Systemic plasma gabapentin concentrations increased approximately 30% during the first 2 hours after hemodialysis as a result of drug redistribution in the body. It is recommended that patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on hemodialysis receive an initial 300-mg to 400-mg gabapentin loading dose. Plasma gabapentin concentrations can be maintained by giving 200 to 300 mg of gabapentin after every 4 hours of hemodialysis.","Acetates/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Administration, Oral, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Anuria/blood/*metabolism/therapy, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dialysis Solutions/*analysis, Female, Half-Life, Humans, Male, Metabolic Clearance Rate, Middle Aged, *Renal Dialysis, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

Eighteen patients with severe spasticity from traumatic or hypoxic brain injury were treated with CIBI. In all patients spasticity could be reduced significantly. The mean Ashworth score was reduced from 4.5 to 2.33 and the mean Spasm frequency score from 2.16 to 0.94. This reduction of spasticity led to a marked pain reduction. Nursing, perineal care and mobilization became much easier. The complication rate was low. In this series we saw one infection in the pump pocket, one epileptic seizure after a bolus application of baclofen and one spinal catheter displacement. The results are similar to those reported from series of patients with spinal spasticity and correspond to the limited experience we have so far with supraspinal spasticity patients. To prevent limb contractures CIBI should be performed as soon as the patient is in a stable clinical condition after brain injury. Further prospective clinical trials will be necessary to obtain more experience with patients suffering from supraspinal spasticity.","Adult, Aged, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Brain Injuries/*complications, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Humans, Hypoxia, Brain/*complications, Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology, Treatment Outcome",-1
11918647,The medical management of spasticity.,Abbruzzese G,Eur J Neurol. 2002 May;9 Suppl 1:30-4; discussion 53-61.,"When spasticity produces a clinical disability by interfering with posture, motor capacity, nursing or daily living activities, medical treatment is recommended. It is mainly indicated when the muscle overactivity is diffusely distributed and should be implemented early, to prevent permanent musculoskeletal deformities or contractures. A pharmacological approach relies on the use of drugs which modulate neurotransmitters acting at the cortico-spinal level (GABA, glycine, glutamate, noradrenaline, serotonin). The aim of this treatment is to decrease spinal reflex excitability by reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, or by potentiating the activity of inhibitory inputs. Evaluation of the efficacy of these drugs is determined by the therapeutic objectives which may be biomechanical, or functional. Diazepam increases presynaptic inhibition by stimulating GABA(A) receptors in the brainstem and spinal cord. In double-blind studies of patients with spinal cord lesions, antispastic efficacy has been shown, but side-effects are common. Baclofen stimulates GABA(B) receptors inducing a suppression of excitatory neurotransmitter release. Antispastic efficacy is sufficiently documented, but no definite effects on ambulation or activities of daily living have been proved. Tizanidine has an alpha2-agonist activity (at spinal and supraspinal level) and decreases the presynaptic activity of excitatory interneurones. The main clinical effects are a reduction in tonic stretch, polysynaptic reflexes, and co-contraction, with fewer side-effects but no definite functional change. The efficacy of several other antispastic drugs is documented in a few controlled studies, but the majority of information arises from open trials or anecdotal observations.","Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/therapy, Sympathectomy, Chemical",-1

METHODS: Medline, Embase, and The Cochrane Clinical Trials Register were the primary sources of trials, but all trials found were included. Minimal requirements: seizure-prevention outcome given as fraction of cases; AED or control assigned by random or quasi-random mechanism. Single abstracter. Aggregate relative risk and heterogeneity evaluated using Mantel-Haenszel analyses; random effects model used if heterogeneity was significant. RESULTS: Forty-seven trials evaluated seven drugs or combinations for preventing seizures associated with fever, alcohol, malaria, perinatal asphyxia, contrast media, tumors, craniotomy, and traumatic brain injury. Effective: Phenobarbital for recurrence of febrile seizures [relative risk (RR), 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.32-0.82) and cerebral malaria (RR, 0.36; CI, 0.23-0.56). Diazepam for contrast media-associated seizures (RR, 0.10; CI, 0.01-0.79). Phenytoin for provoked seizures after craniotomy or traumatic brain injury (craniotomy: RR, 0.42; CI, 0.25-0.71; TBI: RR, 0.33; CI, 0.19-0.59). Carbamazepine for provoked seizures after traumatic brain injury (RR, 0.39; CI, 0.17-0.92). Lorazepam for alcohol-related seizures (RR, 0.12; CI, 0.04-0.40). More than 25% reduction ruled out valproate for unprovoked seizures after traumatic brain injury (RR, 1.28; CI, 0.76-2.16), and carbamazepine for unprovoked seizures after craniotomy (RR, 1.30; CI, 0.75-2.25). CONCLUSIONS: Effective or promising results predominate for provoked (acute, symptomatic) seizures. For unprovoked (epileptic) seizures, no drug has been shown to be effective, and some have had a clinically important effect ruled out.","Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Brain Diseases/complications, Brain Injuries/complications, Carbamazepine/therapeutic use, Controlled Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data, Diazepam/therapeutic use, Epilepsy/etiology/*prevention & control, Humans, Lorazepam/therapeutic use, Models, Statistical, Phenobarbital/therapeutic use, Phenytoin/therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data, Risk, Seizures/etiology/*prevention & control, Treatment Outcome, Valproic Acid/therapeutic use",-1

Using a randomized, double-blind study design, we studied 150 women undergoing gynecologic incontinence surgery with standardized general anesthesia. At the end of surgery, the patients received either tropisetron 5 mg, droperidol 1.25 mg, or 0.9% saline intravenously (i.v.). As a rescue antiemetic, the patients received metoclopramide 10 mg i.v.. The episodes of nausea, retching, and vomiting; the need for rescue treatment; and the type and severity of adverse events were recorded at four occasions during the 48-h observation period. Pain, anxiety, drowsiness, and general satisfaction were also evaluated on a linear numerical scale of 0-10. Complete response (no PONV within the 48-h observation period) occurred similarly in the study groups (tropisetron 25%, droperidol 22%, and placebo 18%). Tropisetron and droperidol had no effect on the incidence of nausea and retching. However, the incidence of vomiting was significantly less in the tropisetron group than in the placebo group (tropisetron 19%, droperidol 45%, and placebo 57%). The number of emetic episodes (retching and/or vomiting) per patient within 48 h was significantly decreased under tropisetron when compared with placebo (tropisetron 2.5 +/- 3.4, droperidol 4.2 +/- 6.1, placebo 5.9 +/- 7.1). With regard to adverse events, the patients in the droperidol group had significantly more anxiety than the placebo group (2-6 h postoperatively), more drowsiness than the tropisetron and placebo groups (0-2 h postoperatively), and more dissatisfaction than the tropisetron (0-6 h postoperatively) and placebo groups (2-6 h postoperatively). We conclude that tropisetron given 5 mg i.v. during anesthesia in gynecologic incontinence surgery effectively prevents vomiting but not nausea and retching, while 1.25 mg i.v. droperidol fails to prevent any of these emetic symptoms and results in adverse events.","Antiemetics/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Droperidol/*therapeutic use, Female, Genital Diseases, Female/*surgery, Humans, Indoles/*therapeutic use, Middle Aged, Nausea/*prevention & control, Postoperative Complications/*prevention & control, Sodium Chloride/therapeutic use, Vomiting/*prevention & control",-1

The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, prospective study was to measure the effects of esmolol infused during CPB on cardiac function as measured by calculated indices of cardiac work and by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Patients scheduled for CPB were randomized to receive intravenous esmolol (300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 during CPB after bolus of 2 mg/kg prior to CPB) or placebo. Infusion was stopped at 10 min after release of aortic cross-clamp. Hemodynamics and TEE were recorded during the procedure. Fractional area of contraction (FAC), an approximation of left ventricular ejection fraction, was calculated from end-diastolic and end-systolic areas. Esmolol was administered to 15 patients and placebo to 14. Heart rates in the esmolol group were lower during infusion and prior to CPB (P < 0.05). Stroke volume index and left ventricular stroke work index were higher in the esmolol group at 15 min post-CPB (P < 0.05). FAC was higher in the esmolol group at 15 and 30 min post-CPB (P < 0.05), but no difference was observed between groups at 1 h post-CPB.

PROCEDURES: Fifty-five patients (36 females) were re-examined by means of a standardized interview after inpatient withdrawal. The mean observation period was 9.28 +/- 2.85 years (mean +/- SD; median 8.58; range 5.00-13.50). RESULTS: Five years after withdrawal, one-third of the patients (34.6%) had an overall favourable outcome, one-third (32.7%) had no recurrent drug overuse and reported a clear-cut improvement of headache, and one-third (32.7%) developed recurrent drug overuse. Most relapses occurred within 2 years, and a small percentage within 5 years. No predictors for long-term outcome after inpatient withdrawal were found.

This pilot study assessed the drug's efficacy in 14 children with congenital or acquired spastic quadriplegia and concomitant intractable epilepsy refractory to treatment with multiple antiepileptic drugs. The primary outcome variable was change in motor function; the secondary outcome was change in seizure frequency. Tiagabine was initiated at 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day and then gradually titrated upward until seizures ceased, adverse effects supervened, or the maximum dose of 1.1 mg/kg/day was reached. When a modified Ashworth scale was used to assess motor function, a mean improvement of approximately 50% was observed. Common findings included improved tone, strength, coordination, range of motion, and relaxation of extremities, with less ataxia and wobbling. Mean reduction in seizure frequency was 50-74%. Randomized, double-blind controlled studies are needed to confirm the suggested efficacy of tiagabine in relieving chronic spasticity in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.","Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Epilepsy/complications/*drug therapy, Female, GABA Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Humans, Infant, Male, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy, Nipecotic Acids/*therapeutic use, Pilot Projects, Quadriplegia/complications/*drug therapy, Recovery of Function, Treatment Outcome",-1

The authors studied changes in the occurrence of somatic dysfunctions in five patients during an 8-day period following discontinuation from large doses of carisoprodol. Results showed that the number of somatic dysfunctions changed significantly during the withdrawal period. Each patient had an increase in the number of somatic dysfunctions during the first 3 days after cessation of carisoprodol with return to at or near baseline by the eighth day. This was reflected statistically in a significant-within-subjects effect for time. Results of supplemental analyses revealed a significant component of the effect and a trend for the quadratic component to be significant. Increases in the number of somatic dysfunctions during carisoprodol discontinuation support the existence of a carisoprodol withdrawal syndrome.","Adult, Carisoprodol/*adverse effects, Female, Humans, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*adverse effects, Somatosensory Disorders/*chemically induced/physiopathology, *Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/physiopathology",-1

Spasticity was assessed with the Ashworth scale of muscle tone and range of motion was evaluated. Thirty-eight patients who had been treated with CIBI for at least 6 months were paired, according to pretreatment UE muscle tone and functional status, with 38 patients who had undergone SPR. The CIBI dosage had been titrated to reduce over lower extremity spasticity and improve lower extremity function, rather than to improve UE tone. The pretreatment muscle tone in the two groups was virtually identical. The UE tone of children treated with CIBI decreased from 2.07 prior to treatment to 1.66 after 1 year (p < 0.01). The tone of children treated with SPR decreased from 2.03 to 1.70 after 1 year (p = 0.005). In that group, the likelihood of a clinically significant reduction in muscle tone (one point or greater) was greater in children with a higher pretreatment UE muscle tone. There was no correlation between the percentage of posterior lumbar roots divided in SPR and the subsequent reduction in UE tone. There were no significant changes in the range of motion in any UE joint, at either 6 or 12 months, after either CIBI or SPR. We conclude that both CIBI and SPR significantly reduce UE spasticity, in addition to the previously documented reduction in lower extremity spasticity.","Arm, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/*drug therapy/physiopathology/*surgery, Child, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Injections, Spinal, Leg, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/physiopathology, Range of Motion, Articular/drug effects, *Rhizotomy",-1

Aged from 23 to 71 years (mean = 39), they presented with a total of 23 stones, of which 18 were located in the calyces, three in the renal pelvis and two in the proximal ureter. The maximum dimensions of calculi varied from 5 to 35 mm (mean = 11). Patients were placed in a dorsal decubitus position during the sessions, three being sedated with diazepam, while the other 12 remained unsedated. All were treated routinely with systemic antibiotics. Auxiliary procedures consisted of two pyelocalyceal flushings, three double J ureteral stenting and three ureteroscopies with fragment removal with a Dormia basket. No episode of autonomic dysreflexia was observed. Short term side effects were limited to a few cases of gross haematuria which regressed spontaneously. Overall, eight successes (53%), and seven failures (47%), were registered. Of the failures, one was the result of a partial fragmentation, while six were related to intrarenal retention of residual fragments resulting in four cases in rapid recurrences. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be easily applied to spinal cord injury patients.

Growth was assessed by determining the height standard deviation scores (HtSDS) and growth velocity (GV) every 4 months. Two hundred age-matched normal children served as controls for the growth data. Endocrine evaluation was performed in 30 randomly selected children with VSD, and 20 age-matched children with constitutional delay of growth (CSS). Growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine provocation was evaluated and circulating free thyroxine (FT4) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) concentrations measured. Echocardiographic evaluation of the different cardiac parameters including shunt size and shunt fraction (Qp/Qs) was performed using a colour-coded echodoppler. The HtSDS, body mass index (BMI), and mid-arm circumference (MAC) of children with VSD were significantly decreased compared to those for the normal control group. The dietary intake evaluated by the recall method, appeared to be adequate in the majority of these children (83/88). IGF-I concentrations were reduced in children with VSD (87.5 +/- 29 ng/ml) versus normal age-matched children (169 +/- 42 ng/ml). Basal and clonidine-stimulated GH concentrations were significantly higher in children with VSD (4.6 +/- 2.1 microg/l and 28.8 +/- 7.9 microg/l respectively) versus controls (17.8 +/- 4.2 microg/l). In these patients (n = 88) the HtSDS was correlated negatively with the size of the shunt (r = -0.793, p < 0.001), shunt fraction (Qp/Qs) (r = -0.76, p < 0.001), pulmonary mean gradient (r = -0.4, p = 0.006), and pulmonary maximum velocity (r = -0.32, p = 0.02). Growth velocity (GV) was correlated negatively with pulmonary maximum gradient (r = -0.3, p = 0.02), pulmonary maximum velocity (r = -0.37, p = 0.007), and pulmonary stroke volume (Qp) (r = -0.345, p = 0.01). The BMI and IGF-I concentrations were correlated significantly with the size of the shunt (r = -0.453, p < 0.01), Qp/Qs (r = -0.432, p < 0.01), HtSDS (r = 0.565, p < 0.01), and BMI (r = 0.435, p < 0.01). It appears that in patients with VSD, the size of the left-to-right shunt and the abnormal hemodynamics in the pulmonary circulation are important factors in the etiology of impaired growth. It is suggested that the hypermetabolic status of these patients compromise nutrition and this decreases IGF-I synthesis with subsequent slowing of linear growth and weight gain.","Body Mass Index, Case-Control Studies, Child, Child, Preschool, Clonidine/pharmacology, Egypt, Female, Growth Disorders/*etiology/metabolism, Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular/complications/*ultrasonography, Human Growth Hormone/drug effects, Humans, Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism, Male, Thyrotropin/blood, Thyroxine/blood",-1
12577086,Tetanus.,"Bhatia R, Prabhakar S, Grover VK",Neurol India. 2002 Dec;50(4):398-407.,"Tetanus is a potentially life threatening disease affecting nearly 50,000 to 1 million people world wide every year. Four major clinical forms of tetanus are described i.e. generalized, cephalic, localized and neonatal. Neonatal tetanus is particularly common in developing countries, due to unhygienic child birth practices, social taboos and improper immunization of pregnant mothers. Management of this disorder involves a team approach and aims at eradicating focus of infection, neutralizing the toxin, controlling spasms and dysautonomia and providing adequate ventilatory and supportive care. Metronidazole may be the preferred antibiotic although penicillin is still used frequently. Adequate wound debridement is necessary to prevent spore germination. Spasms are usually managed by sedatives like diazepam and neuromuscular blocking agents. Magnesium sulphate is an attractive substitute and may be tried if ventilatory facilities are unavailable. Use of baclofen is potentially advantageous but cannot be routinely prescribed. Dysautonomia is difficult to manage and requires therapy with benzodiazepines, morphine, magnesium sulphate, adrenergic blockers and recently tried baclofen therapy. Supportive care including ventilatory assistance are highly essential for successful outcome of the patients. It is imperative that complications are diagnosed early and managed appropriately. Immunization is extremely effective and is the key to prevention. Adequate steps and measures should be taken to increase awareness of this potentially preventable disease.","Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Immunization, Incidence, Preventive Medicine, Tetanus/*diagnosis/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy",-1

Although rare, neurological complications such as brain metastases can develop. It remains unclear, however, what role chemotherapy has in the treatment of these patients and what route of administration is most effective. Intra-arterial (IA) regional administration of chemotherapy may increase intra-tumoral drug concentrations and improve efficacy. We report the case of a 47-year-old woman who developed bilateral fallopian tube cancer and multifocal brain metastases. After progression through radiation therapy and oral chemotherapy, she was placed on IA carboplatin (200 mg/m2/d x 2 days every 4 weeks) and intravenous etoposide (100 mg/m2/d x 2 days every 4 weeks). During treatment she had objective tumor shrinkage that has remained stable for more than 12 months. For patients with fallopian tube carcinoma that develop brain metastases and respond poorly to surgery and/or irradiation, multi-agent chemotherapy containing carboplatin should be considered.

This parameter reviews published literature relevant to the decision to begin treatment after a child or adolescent experiences a first unprovoked seizure and presents evidence-based practice recommendations. Reasons why treatment may be considered are discussed. Evidence is reviewed concerning risk of recurrence as well as effect of treatment on prevention of recurrence and development of chronic epilepsy. Studies of side effects of anticonvulsants commonly used to treat seizures in children are also reviewed. Relevant articles are classified according to the Quality Standards Subcommittee classification scheme. Treatment after a first unprovoked seizure appears to decrease the risk of a second seizure, but there are few data from studies involving only children. There appears to be no benefit of treatment with regard to the prognosis for long-term seizure remission. Antiepileptic drugs (AED) carry risks of side effects that are particularly important in children. The decision as to whether or not to treat children and adolescents who have experienced a first unprovoked seizure must be based on a risk-benefit assessment that weighs the risk of having another seizure against the risk of chronic AED therapy. The decision should be individualized and take into account both medical issues and patient and family preference.","Adolescent, Adult, Anticonvulsants/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Behavior/drug effects, Child, Child, Preschool, Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data, Cognition/drug effects, Cohort Studies, Drug Eruptions, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Prognosis, Recurrence/prevention & control, Remission Induction, Risk Assessment, Seizures/classification/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Sleep Stages/drug effects, Treatment Outcome, United States",-1
10590412,Peripheral and central effect of baclofen on ankle joint stiffness in multiple sclerosis.,"Nielsen JF, Sinkjaer T",Muscle Nerve. 2000 Jan;23(1):98-105.,"The effect of baclofen on the soleus stretch reflex and peripheral muscle function was tested in 10 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with spasticity in the lower extremities. Peroral baclofen (15-60 mg daily) induced a decrease in the twitch torque of the soleus muscle elicited by supramaximal nerve stimulation. The torque was 15.1 +/- 5.5 Nm with baclofen and 17.1 +/- 5.0 Nm without baclofen (P = 0.03). The slope of the background torque/EMG relation was also changed from 1.53 Nm/microV with baclofen to 1.13 NM/microV without it (P = 0.03), and the soleus stretch reflex threshold decreased from 11.4 degrees /s (3.1-62.8) to 6.2 degrees /s (3.1-25.1) without baclofen medication (P = 0.03) in the relaxed muscle. Furthermore, baclofen induced an approximately 20% decrease in the total stiffness at the ankle joint at all contraction levels due to a decrease in the short-latency stretch reflex. From a clinical point of view, the peripheral action of baclofen may be unfortunate. Spasticity is often accompanied by weakness, which may be the major cause of any disability. Consequently, reduction in spasticity by the central effect of baclofen may be counteracted by its influence on muscle properties. In addition, treatment of spasticity by baclofen may unmask weakness.","Adult, *Ankle Joint, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Biomechanical Phenomena, Central Nervous System/*drug effects, Electromyography/drug effects, Electrophysiology, Female, H-Reflex/drug effects, Humans, Joint Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/physiology, Peripheral Nerves/*drug effects, Reflex, Stretch/drug effects",-1
7510495,Reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Current perspectives and future possibilities.,"Del Favero A, Roila F, Tonato M",Drug Saf. 1993 Dec;9(6):410-28.,"Nausea and vomiting are among the most distressing adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy. In the last 10 years considerable advances in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis have been made. From an analysis of the results obtained in patients receiving moderately- to severely-emetogenic drugs the following guidelines in choosing the best antiemetic treatment can be given: 1. For the prevention of acute emesis induced by a high single dose of cisplatin (> or = 50 mg/m2) or by low doses (20 to 40 mg/m2) repeated for 4 to 5 days, the combination of ondansetron plus dexamethasone is the most efficacious and least toxic antiemetic therapy. 2. For the prevention of delayed emesis the combination of oral dexamethasone plus metoclopramide seems to offer the best protection, although over 40% of patients still experience delayed nausea and vomiting. 3. For the prevention of acute emesis induced by moderately emetogenic drugs, corticosteroids (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone) are efficacious and safe antiemetic agents. Although equally efficacious, the serotonin (5-HT)3 receptor antagonists, due to their higher acquisition costs, are indicated only in patients refractory to corticosteroids or in those who cannot use them. Unresolved problems in antiemetic research include: (i) identification of the best antiemetic treatment for those areas of cancer chemotherapy where adequate data are lacking, such as high dose regimens for bone marrow transplantation; (ii) optimisation of treatment for the most widely used chemotherapy regimens; and (iii) identification of the best rescue treatment for patients who fail to respond to antiemetic prophylaxis. Although many new 5-HT3 antagonists are currently being studied, the possible improvement in efficacy and tolerability brought about by these agents will probably only be marginal.","Antiemetics/*therapeutic use, Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects, Cisplatin/adverse effects, Clinical Trials as Topic, Double-Blind Method, Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use, Humans, Nausea/*chemically induced/prevention & control, Prospective Studies, Serotonin Antagonists/*therapeutic use, Vomiting/*chemically induced/prevention & control",-1

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether such an abnormal response to morphine challenge is entirely dependent on opioid receptor activation. A role for excitatory amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid has been proposed on the basis of the effect of diazepam. As opposed to naloxone, this gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist was found to inhibit the adverse effects of low doses of morphine in migraine sufferers, while at the same time being able to almost abolish morphine-induced miosis in subjects who underwent a short-lasting chronic pretreatment. The capacity of diazepam either to control the adverse effects of morphine or to induce well-being in subjects known to suffer from a central neurogenic pain such as migraine, is noteworthy even regarding the clinical treatment of other painful conditions, such as deafferentation pain, which is known to be not satisfactorily treated by using morphine.","Adult, Cross-Over Studies, Diazepam/pharmacology, Double-Blind Method, Excitatory Amino Acids/*metabolism, Humans, Migraine Disorders/drug therapy/*metabolism, Morphine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Naloxone/pharmacology, Narcotic Antagonists/pharmacology, Narcotics/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Pain/metabolism, Receptors, Opioid/drug effects/metabolism, gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*metabolism",-1

A review of its pharmacology, clinical efficacy and tolerability in the management of spasticity associated with cerebral and spinal disorders.","Wagstaff AJ, Bryson HM",Drugs. 1997 Mar;53(3):435-52.,"The central alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist tizanidine is a myotonolytic agent used in the treatment of spasticity in patients with cerebral or spinal injury. Wide interpatient variability in the effective plasma concentrations of tizanidine means that the optimal dosage must be titrated over 2 to 4 weeks for each patient (dosages of 2 to 36 mg/day have been used in clinical trials). Maximum effects occur within 2 hours of administration. Antispastic efficacy has been demonstrated for tizanidine in placebo-controlled trials, with reduction in mean muscle tone scores of 21 to 37% versus 4 to 9% for patients receiving placebo. Improvement in muscle tone occurred in 60 to 82% of tizanidine recipients, compared with 60 to 65% of baclofen and 60 to 83% of diazepam recipients. Spasm frequency and clonus are also reduced by tizanidine. The most common adverse effects associated with tizanidine are dry mouth and somnolence/drowsiness. Muscle strength, as assessed by objective means, appears not to be adversely affected by tizanidine and subjective muscle weakness is reported less often by tizanidine recipients than by those receiving baclofen or diazepam. Global tolerability was assessed as good to excellent in 44 to 100% of patients receiving tizanidine, compared with 38 to 90% of baclofen and 20 to 54% of diazepam recipients. In conclusion, tizanidine is an antispastic agent with similar efficacy to that of baclofen and a more favourable tolerability profile. While drowsiness is a frequently reported adverse effect with both agents, subjective muscle weakness appears to be less of a problem with tizanidine than with baclofen. Tizanidine, therefore, appears to be an attractive therapeutic alternative for patients with spasticity associated with cerebral or spinal damage.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Animals, Brain Diseases/*complications/*drug therapy, Clinical Trials as Topic, Clonidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Humans, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy, Parasympatholytics/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2/drug effects, Spinal Cord Diseases/*chemically induced/*drug therapy",-1

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the history, use, and innovation related to neuraxial drug delivery for the treatment of intractable back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The discovery of opioid receptors in the early 1970s provided a rational basis for the delivery of opioid drugs intraspinally. Epidural or intrathecal infusions deliver drugs directly to opioid receptors, limit systemic exposure, and by decreasing the opioid dosage required for pain relief, generally reduce side effects. The benefits of short-term spinal analgesia led to investigation of longer-term continuous subarachnoid opioid infusions for the management of both cancer pain and noncancer pain, such as that of spinal origin. METHODS: RESULTS: Unique features of this article include an updated pain continuum, updated indications for intrathecal therapy, a detailed comparison of trial techniques, a detailed comparison of the advantages of different types of pumps, a synopsis of troubleshooting for inadequate efficacy, and an updated statement regarding intrathecal pumps and radiologic procedures, including MRI scanning. Some challenges remain. Large-scale well-controlled studies could answer some perplexing questions regarding efficacy in patients with noncancer or neuropathic pain. Patient selection criteria undoubtedly will be refined and validated as more patients are treated. In addition, further investigation of specifically targeted medications or drug combinations for intraspinal use could increase efficacy, reduce side effects, and expand indications. CONCLUSIONS: Intraspinal medication delivery has become an effective technique for control of intractable pain in appropriately selected patients seen by spine surgeons.","Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/administration & dosage, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage, Animals, Back Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology, Chronic Disease, Drug Administration Routes, Drug Delivery Systems/instrumentation/methods, Humans, Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects, Orthopedic Procedures/adverse effects, Spinal Diseases/*complications, Spinal Neoplasms/complications",-1
9391686,Baclofen toxicity in patients with severely impaired renal function.,"Chen KS, Bullard MJ, Chien YY, Lee SY",Ann Pharmacother. 1997 Nov;31(11):1315-20.,"OBJECTIVE: To report the toxic effects of baclofen in patients with severely impaired renal function. DATA SOURCES: From 1991 to 1995, nine patients with severely impaired renal function (2 not receiving dialysis, 1 undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD], and 6 receiving maintenance hemodialysis), who exhibited clinical toxicity after baclofen therapy at our hospital were included for analysis. Another seven cases from the literature obtained by computerized (MEDLINE) and manual (Index Medicus) search methods published between 1980 and 1995 were also reviewed. INTERVENTION: Among our nine patients, the six undergoing chronic hemodialysis and one not undergoing dialysis received early (< 48 h) hemodialysis after toxic symptoms developed. The patient undergoing CAPD received late hemodialysis (> 72 h), and the other patient who had not undergone dialysis received only supportive care. RESULTS: A review of these 16 cases revealed that most patients received only small doses and very short-term baclofen therapy. Altered consciousness was the major presenting feature. Severe acute complications, such as seizures and respiratory depression, were relatively uncommon among patients with severely impaired renal function. However, abdominal pain, which has previously rarely been reported, was noted in five of our nine patients. Most patients showed clinical improvement after hemodialysis. An analysis of these nine patients revealed that those who received early hemodialysis had a shorter recovery time than the patient who received only supportive care (2.71 +/- 0.42, respectively, vs. 9 d; p < 0.01). A lag of several hours between the end of the hemodialysis session and an improvement in the level of consciousness was noted. DISCUSSION: As most patients with severely impaired renal function developed toxic symptoms soon after initiating a low-dose baclofen regimen, the accumulated dosage was small and severe complications were less common. Abdominal pain may have occurred as a result of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated cholinergic effect exerted by baclofen. The delay in conscious recovery after hemodialysis may be due to a delay in the clearance of baclofen from the central nervous system. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severely impaired renal function generally develop baclofen intoxication soon after the initiation of low-dose therapy. Thus, the administration of baclofen, regardless of the dosage, in these patients is not appropriate. Abdominal pain, in addition to altered consciousness, is a common presenting feature in patients with renal failure who have baclofen intoxication. Hemodialysis is effective in alleviating the clinical symptoms and shortening the recovery time for such patients.","Adult, Aged, Baclofen/adverse effects/*contraindications/*poisoning, Central Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced, Female, Humans, Kidney Failure, Chronic/*complications/therapy, Male, Middle Aged, Poisoning/therapy, Renal Dialysis",-1
8586026,Antivertigo medications and drug-induced vertigo. A pharmacological review.,"Rascol O, Hain TC, Brefel C, Benazet M, Clanet M, Montastruc JL",Drugs. 1995 Nov;50(5):777-91.,"The approach to drug treatment of vertigo is almost exclusively symptomatic. There are 3 major goals for drug treatment of vertigo. The first one is to eliminate the hallucination of motion. Drugs with vestibular 'suppressant' properties are used for this purpose. The major vestibular suppressants are anticholinergic and antihistamine drugs. The second goal is to reduce the accompanying neurovegetative and psychoaffective signs (nausea, vomiting, anxiety). Antidopaminergics are used for this purpose. The third goal is to enhance the process of 'vestibular compensation' to allow the brain to find a new sensory equilibrium in spite of the vestibular lesion. Until now, the pharmacological manipulation of vestibular compensation has been assessed in animals but not in humans with vestibular lesions. Vestibular suppressant drugs delay rather than enhance compensation. A variety of other drugs is also used in the treatment of vertigo, including benzodiazepines, histaminergic agents, sympathomimetics and calcium antagonists. Their mechanism of action is poorly understood. The data base derived from clinical trials evaluating antivertigo medications is often questionable because of methodological limitations. This explains why habits of prescription are mainly empirical, and why striking differences can be noticed from one country to another. We can hope that new treatments may emerge from the present interest in receptor subclasses and neuromodulators of the vestibular system, and we must be ready to evaluate these potential new pharmacological agents with reliable clinical methods in humans.","Animals, Brain Chemistry/drug effects/physiology, Humans, Vertigo/*chemically induced/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Vestibule, Labyrinth/drug effects/physiopathology",-1

Medical literature supports the use of SSRIs for the treatment of many conditions outside of the indications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. SSRIs offer a reasonable alternative to traditional therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. A side effect of SSRIs coincidentally provides therapy for premature ejaculation. SSRIs may reduce the frequency and severity of migraine headaches and are possibly effective in reducing the pain of diabetic neuropathy. When taken in combination with tricyclic antidepressants, SSRis offer more potent therapy for fibromyalgia than either agent alone. SSRIs appear to be effective in some patients with neurocardiogenic syncope that is refractory to standard therapies. Clinical experience supported by ongoing research continues to expand on the broad array of therapeutic applications for this class of medication.","Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Approval, Drug Utilization, Fibromyalgia/drug therapy, Humans, Safety, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use",-1

7746398,Common drugs may influence motor recovery after stroke. The Sygen In Acute Stroke Study Investigators.,Goldstein LB,Neurology. 1995 May;45(5):865-71.,"Studies in laboratory animals indicate that certain centrally acting drugs (eg, the antihypertensives clonidine and prazosin, neuroleptics and other dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, and the anticonvulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital) impair behavioral recovery after focal brain injury. Even single doses may have long-term harmful effects. To determine whether these medications have a similar negative impact in humans, we analyzed the recoveries of control patients who were enrolled in the Sygen in Acute Stroke Study, a multicenter study of the effects of GM1 ganglioside after ischemic stroke. Motor impairments were measured by the motor subscores of the Toronto Stroke Scale at baseline and 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 days after stroke. Using these data, we compared motor recovery between patients with initial motor deficits who received at least one of the drugs that interfere with recovery in laboratory studies (""detrimental"" drug group, n = 37) and patients who did not receive these drugs (""neutral"" drug group, n = 59). The groups were well balanced with regard to the frequency of comorbid conditions and other prognostic factors. For upper-extremity motor function, repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between drug group and time after stroke [F(6,528) = 2.38; p = 0.03], with a significant (p < 0.001) difference between the groups beginning 7 days after the stroke. A similar trend was present for the lower extremity, but the overall difference between the groups was not significant [ANOVA F(6,498) = 1.22; p = 0.29].

The clinical picture consists of generalized fasciculations, progressive atrophy and weakness of the skeletal muscles, spasticity and pyramidal tract signs, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Pseudobulbar affect is common. Disease-specific treatment options are still unsatisfactory. Therapeutic nihilism is not justified as a large array of palliative measures available to enhance the quality of life of patients and their families. Because of its clinical characteristics, ALS represents a paradigm for palliative care in neurological diseases. Numerous projects are being undertaken worldwide in an effort to enlarge the evidence base for palliative interventions in ALS. Palliative care in ALS is a multidisciplinary effort requiring careful coordination. An open and empathic disclosure of the diagnosis is essential. Nutritional deficiency caused by dysphagia can be relieved by a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Respiratory insufficiency can be effectively treated by non-invasive home mechanical ventilation. The terminal phase of the disease should be discussed at the latest when symptoms of dyspnea appear, in order to prevent unwarranted fears of ""choking to death.""

The treatments were given weekly over 8 weeks. Global and continuous outcome measures were used. Analysis was by chi-square for global data and MANOVA with baseline scores as covariants for continuous variables. No significant differences could be demonstrated. The scores over a 6-month follow-up period suggested a delayed positive advantage for CBT but this only approached and did not achieve statistical significance.

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted to identify English language literature published within the last five years on the four SSRIs (fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine). Previous review articles were scrutinized for additional citations, and manufacturers provided a contemporary bibliography of more recent material. STUDY SELECTION/DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected for specific citation on the basis of comparative research merit and the contribution of this original literature to the pharmacologic profile(s) described. DATA SYNTHESIS: All SSRIs appear to be more efficacious than placebo for the acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Short-term (six-week) efficacy was comparable with that of tricyclic antidepressants for the amelioration of MDD regarded as moderate in severity. Further comparative trials are clearly indicated to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of SSRIs in specific populations (e.g., geriatric, severely ill) and to demonstrate sustained benefit with long-term prophylaxis. Other potential indications for SSRIs include obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, bulimia, and chronic pain syndromes. Pharmacokinetic profiles of the four SSRIs reveal similar parametric values, and most quantitative differences are of limited clinical significance. Adverse effects are common but ordinarily mild and transient, primarily restricted to the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Important differences in the prevalence or severity of these adverse effects await the accumulation of further clinical experience and the completion of additional comparative trials. Similarly, the relative propensity of SSRIs to inhibit the metabolism of other medications is currently under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The four SSRIs studied appear to be more similar than they are different. Slowly, important distinctions are beginning to emerge with regard to adverse effect profiles and potential drug interactions. Given that the costs of these respective medications are comparable, such differences may ultimately serve to establish the preferential selection of individual agents in specific clinical situations.","1-Naphthylamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Alcoholism/drug therapy, Antidepressive Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/drug therapy, Clinical Trials as Topic, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy, Drug Interactions, Fluoxetine/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Fluvoxamine/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Humans, Paroxetine/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Sertraline",-1

RESULTS: Despite the increase of hGH during hypoglycemia, a statistically significant decrease of IGF-1 was observed along with the expected rise of cortisol and NE. To eliminate the role played by NE, NE tone was depressed by administering clonidine. A statistically significant decrease of IGF-1 was also observed.

Preclinical and clinical studies indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability in damaged areas of the central nervous system plays a major role in the development of CP. Anticonvulsants are thought to act by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibition, decreasing abnormal neuronal hyperexcitability by modulating sodium and calcium channels or by inhibiting excitatory amino acid actions. The resulting inhibition of excess neuronal activity is thought to be the basis for the use of anticonvulsants in epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain. Both first-generation anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., phenytoin, benzodiazepines, valproate and carbamazepine) and second-generation anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., lamotrigine, gabapentin and topiramate) are used in CP conditions. However, few randomised controlled trials on the treatment of this condition have been published. Present suggestions for anticonvulsant treatment of CP are lamotrigine as the first choice, followed by gabapentin or carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine. These compounds are considered as effective as the antidepressant amitriptyline.","Animals, Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Central Nervous System/*injuries, Central Nervous System Diseases/*complications, Humans, Multiple Sclerosis/complications, Pain/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Spinal Cord Injuries/complications, Stroke/complications",-1

MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Laboratory studies show that systemically-administered drugs that affect specific central neurotransmitters including norepinephrine and GABA influence affect recovery in a predictable manner. Although some drugs such as d-amphetamine have the potential to enhance recovery, others such as neuroleptics and other central dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines and the anti-convulsants phenytoin and phenobarbital may be detrimental. In one study, 72% of patients with traumatic brain injury received one or a combination of the drugs that may impair recovery based on both animal experiments and studies in recovering stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: Until the true impact of these classes of drugs are better understood, care should be exercised in the use of medications that may interfere with the recovery process in patients with traumatic brain injury. Additional research needs to be completed before the clinical efficacy of drugs that may enhance recovery can be established.","Amphetamines/adverse effects, Animals, Brain Injuries/*drug therapy, Central Nervous System Agents/*adverse effects, Drug Combinations, GABA Agents/adverse effects, Humans, Models, Animal, Neuronal Plasticity/*drug effects, Norepinephrine/physiology, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Recovery of Function/drug effects",-1
11336614,Review of rivastigmine and its clinical applications in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.,"Desai A, Grossberg G",Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2001 Apr;2(4):653-66.,"Rivastigmine (Exelontrade mark, Novartis) is a novel intermediate-acting reversible and non-competitive carbamate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) that was recently introduced for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical studies have shown that rivastigmine has many similarities to other currently available cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and some important differences. The drug has been evaluated for this use in two well designed, published, adequately powered, Phase III, 26 week clinical trials that included a total of more than 1500 rivastigmine and 700 placebo recipients. Most of these patients had concomitant disorders that were being treated with numerous other drugs. These studies indicate that rivastigmine (6 - 12 mg/day) usually produces cognitive, global and functional changes that indicate significantly less deterioration than was observed with placebo in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, with higher doses producing more benefits. Rivastigmine is beneficial in all three domains (namely cognition, daily activities and behaviour) of AD. Data on long-term efficacy support continued benefits of rivastigmine beyond 6 months. Rivastigmine is generally well-tolerated with no requirement for routine electrocardiogram (ECG) or blood monitoring. Rivastigmine causes adverse events that are generally those expected from a ChEI and mainly involve gastrointestinal system. They are usually mild-to-moderate, of short duration and responsive to dosage reduction. They occur mostly during the dosage titration phase and decrease during the maintenance phase. Clinically significant drug-drug interactions are unlikely. The consistent efficacy in treating all three domains (cognition, daily functioning and behaviour) and good tolerability, particularly with slow titration, makes rivastigmine a good first-line ChEI therapy for the treatment of AD. Therapeutic dose range is 6 - 12 mg/day. Rivastigmine should be started at 1.5 mg b.i.d. with meals and increased at 2 - 4 week intervals to achieve the highest tolerated dose.","Alzheimer Disease/*drug therapy, Carbamates/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Cholinesterase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Interactions, Humans, Neuroprotective Agents/*therapeutic use, Patient Selection, *Phenylcarbamates",-1
12856488,Neurosurgery for intractable obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression: critical issues.,"Greenberg BD, Price LH, Rauch SL, Friehs G, Noren G, Malone D, Carpenter LL, Rezai AR, Rasmussen SA",Neurosurg Clin N Am. 2003 Apr;14(2):199-212.,"Intractable OCD and depression cause tremendous suffering in those affected and in their families. The impaired ability to function of those affected imposes a heavy burden on society as a whole. Existing data suggest that lesion procedures offer benefit to a large proportion (ranging from about 35%-70%) of patients with intractable OCD and depression. The literature also suggests that although serious long-term adverse events have occurred, these are relatively infrequent overall. Methodologic limitations of the earlier reports on any of these procedures were described previously in this article. The major academic centers conducting this work have since been obtaining systematic prospective data using modern assessment tools. Nevertheless, even with improved methodologies, more recent studies confront some remaining issues that have been difficult to overcome fully. First, the number of patients who have received any one procedure has been relatively small, constraining statistical power. This limits the ability of researchers to enhance patient selection based on clinical characteristics. This is important, because patients with intractable OCD and depression referred for neurosurgery have high rates of comorbid Axis I diagnoses, personality disorders, and functional impairments, which may have value in predicting response. Other features, such as age of onset, chronicity, and symptom subtypes, may be likewise useful. Another key factor in response may be postoperative management, which has varied most over time but also across patients enrolled in trials. As noted previously, randomized controlled trials of neurosurgical treatment for intractable psychiatric illness have not been reported, although one has been proposed for gamma knife capsulotomy in intractable OCD [23]. The development of deep brain stimulation has also made sham-controlled studies possible and also allows within-patient designs to be considered. Bearing these problems in mind, the literature does provide important guidance on a number of key points, including approaches to referral, patient selection, and the need for long-term prospective follow-up and postoperative management. Nevertheless, important gaps in knowledge remain in all these areas. Research is expected to narrow these gaps in a number of ways, including patient selection, optimizing the procedures themselves, and understanding the mechanisms of therapeutic action. Neuroimaging studies will play a key role in achieving these aims (see the article by Rauch in this issue). So will cross-species translational research on the anatomy and physiology of the pathways implicated in the pathophysiology and response to treatment in these disorders. Future research in psychiatric neurosurgery must proceed cautiously. A recent editorial statement of the OCD-DBS Collaborative Group [26] recommends a minimum set of standards for any multidisciplinary teams contemplating work in this domain. The rationale for those standards is found throughout this issue and is especially developed in the article by Fins. The need for safe and effective therapeutic options for people suffering with these severe illnesses is just as clear. The experience over the last several decades provides grounds for careful optimism that refined lesion procedures or reversible deep brain stimulation may relieve suffering and improve the lives of people with these devastating disorders.","Brain/*surgery, Corpus Callosum/surgery, Depressive Disorder, Major/*surgery, Female, Humans, Limbic System/surgery, Male, Neurosurgical Procedures/adverse effects/*methods, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/*surgery",-1

We carried out a prospective, open study, in 19 patients (11 men) with RGCSE in the intensive care unit at Firat Medical Center in Elazig. When intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg diazepam (three times at 5-min intervals), 20 mg/kg phenytoin, and 20 mg/kg phenobarbital failed to bring the episode under control, patients were administered an intravenous bolus of midazolam (200 microg/kg) followed by a continuous infusion at 1 microg/kg min. The dose was increased by 1 microg/kg min every 15 min until the episode of seizure was brought under control. The time from beginning of treatment to control of seizures, infusion rate, and side-effects were monitored. The mean age of the patients was 40.4 years (range 16-87 years). The clinical etiology of RGCSE was idiopathic epilepsy (6 cases), anoxicischemic cerebral insult due to cardiac arrest (3), viral encephalitis (2), intrahemispheric hematoma due to hemorrhagic stroke (1), cerebral infarct due to ischemic stroke (1), pituitary adenoma (1), post-traumatic epilepsy (1), renal failure (1), tuberculous meningitis (1), and unknown (2). In eighteen (94.7%) patients, seizures were completely controlled in a mean time of 45 min (range, 5-120 min) at a mean infusion rate of 8 microg/kg min (range, 3-21 microg/kg min). In one patient seizures did not stop. Midazolam administration did not cause any significant change in blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, or respiratory status. The mean time to full consciousness for patients after stopping the infusion was 1.6 hours (range, 2.0-8.5 hours). The mean infusion duration of midazolam was 14.5 hours (range, 12-25 hours). Midazolam is an effective and safe drug to control RGCSE, and may represent a substantial improvement over current therapeutic approaches such as pentobarbital anesthesia.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Anticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Blood Pressure/drug effects, Drug Resistance, Female, GABA Modulators/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Heart Rate/drug effects, Humans, Infusions, Intravenous, Male, Midazolam/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Middle Aged, Prospective Studies, Respiration/drug effects, Status Epilepticus/diagnosis/*drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1
7525198,Omeprazole. An update of its pharmacology and therapeutic use in acid-related disorders.,"Wilde MI, McTavish D",Drugs. 1994 Jul;48(1):91-132.,"Omeprazole, a gastric acid pump inhibitor, dose-dependently controls gastric acid secretion: the drug has greater antisecretory activity than histamine H2-receptor antagonists. Omeprazole 20 to 40 mg/day is more effective than histamine H2-receptor antagonists in the short term treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. Available data suggest that omeprazole 10 to 40 mg/day is also more effective than ranitidine in the maintenance therapy of duodenal ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. The drug is also effective in patients with duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer or reflux oesophagitis poorly responsive to histamine H2-receptor antagonists. The efficacy of omeprazole 20 mg/day appears to be similar to that of lansoprazole 30 mg/day in the short term treatment of duodenal ulcer, gastric ulcer and reflux oesophagitis. However, most available studies have been reported in abstract form only, and 2 of 3 studies in patients with duodenal ulcer have shown greater healing rates at 2 (but not 4) weeks with lansoprazole. Helicobacter pylori eradication decreases duodenal ulcer relapse rates and appears to be associated with improved duodenal ulcer healing rates. Evidence also suggests that H. pylori eradication is associated with reduced gastric ulcer relapse rates. Omeprazole monotherapy may suppress but does not eradicate H. pylori infection. Eradication rates with omeprazole 20 or 40 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin usually up to 2 g/day (3 g/day in a few studies) for 2 weeks appear to be similar to those of standard triple therapy (bismuth salt plus metronidazole, plus tetracycline or amoxicillin) or omeprazole plus clarithromycin, although eradication rates vary widely. Omeprazole plus amoxicillin appears to be better tolerated than triple therapy and represents a first-line treatment alternative in patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer disease. Omeprazole plus amoxicillin plus metronidazole appears to be more effective than omeprazole plus amoxicillin in patients with metronidazole-sensitive H. pylori infection. Omeprazole remains a treatment of choice in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The dosages should be adjusted according to individual response. However, relatively low dosages of 10 to 40 mg/day may be sufficient in some patients. The drug has also shown promise in the treatment of children with severe reflux oesophagitis, in patients with reflux oesophagitis and coexisting systemic sclerosis, and in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia. Evidence suggests that omeprazole is more effective than ranitidine in patients with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric damage who continue to take NSAIDs, especially in patients with large gastric ulcers; however, completion of ongoing studies is required to verify this.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Gastric Acid/*secretion, Gastrointestinal Diseases/*drug therapy/etiology, Humans, Omeprazole/adverse effects/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use",-1

Alterations within brain stress systems that secondarily influence the immune system have been documented. A recent report indicated elevations of serotonin (5-HT) and ganglioside antibodies in patients with primary fibromyalgia, a condition with documented associations with panic disorder. In line with our interest in dysregulated 5-HT systems in panic disorder (PD), we wished to assess if antibodies directed at the 5-HT system were elevated in patients with PD in comparison to healthy volunteers. Sixty-three patients with panic disorder and 26 healthy volunteers were diagnosed by the SCID. Employing ELISA, we measured anti-5-HT and 5-HT anti-idiotypic antibodies (which are directed at 5-HT receptors). To include all subjects in one experiment, three different batches were run during the ELISA. Plasma serotonin anti-idiotypic antibodies: there was a significant group effect [patients > controls (p = .007)] and batch effect but no interaction. The mean effect size for the three batches was .76. Following Z-score transformation of each separate batch and then combining all scores, patients demonstrated significantly elevated levels of plasma serotonin anti-idiotypic antibodies. Neither sex nor age as covariates affected the significance of the results. There was a strong correlation between anti-serotonin antibody and serotonin anti-idiotypic antibody measures. Plasma anti-serotonin antibodies: there was a significant diagnosis effect [patients > controls (p = .037)]. Mean effect size for the three batches was .52. Upon Z-score transformation, there was a diagnosis effect with antibody elevations in patients. Covaried for sex and age, the result falls below significance to trend levels. The data raise the possibility that psychoimmune dysfunction, specifically related to the 5-HT system, may be present in PD. Potential interruption of 5-HT neurotransmission through autoimmune mechanisms may be of pathophysiologic significance in certain patients with panic disorder. It remains to be demonstrated if the peripheral autoimmunity is representative of CNS 5-HT neuronal alterations. Replication appears warranted.","Adult, Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*blood, Autoantibodies/*blood, Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay, Female, Humans, Male, Panic Disorder/blood/*immunology/psychology, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Serotonin/*immunology",-1

12131110,Gabapentin suppresses cutaneous hyperalgesia following heat-capsaicin sensitization.,"Dirks J, Petersen KL, Rowbotham MC, Dahl JB",Anesthesiology. 2002 Jul;97(1):102-7.,"BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsant gabapentin, proven effective for neuropathic pain in two large, placebo-controlled clinical trials, is widely used for treatment of chronic pain. Preclinical studies have demonstrated analgesic and antiallodynic effects in models involving neuronal sensitization and nerve injury, without affecting acute pain transmission. The aim of the present study was to link data from animal models and clinical trials for chronic pain by investigating the effect of gabapentin on acute nociception and experimentally induced cutaneous hyperalgesia in healthy volunteers. METHODS: The human experimental hyperalgesia model, the heat-capsaicin sensitization model, was induced in 25 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received oral gabapentin (1,200 mg) or placebo after heat-capsaicin sensitization was established on the forearm. The primary outcome measures were the sizes of the areas of secondary hyperalgesia to von Frey hair and brush stimulation on the forearm. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: (1) size of secondary hyperalgesia area in response to brief thermal sensitization procedure on the thigh; (2) heat pain detection thresholds in normal and sensitized skin; and (3) painfulness of 1 min of 45 degrees C stimulation in normal skin. RESULTS: Oral gabapentin profoundly suppressed established cutaneous sensitization on the forearm and prevented development of cutaneous sensitization on the thigh. Thermal nociception in normal skin was unchanged. Side effects were modest. CONCLUSION: The results link preclinical findings with results from clinical trials of neuropathic pain. The results further suggest that gabapentin may prove effective in acute pain disorders involving neuronal sensitization, such as postoperative pain and acute herpetic pain, and could prove effective in prevention of chronic pain.","Acetates/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use, Adult, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Capsaicin/*pharmacology, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Hot Temperature, Humans, Hyperalgesia/*drug therapy, Male, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

9638387,A risk-benefit assessment of pharmacological treatments for panic disorder.,"Bennett JA, Moioffer M, Stanton SP, Dwight M, Keck PE Jr",Drug Saf. 1998 Jun;18(6):419-30.,"Panic disorder, a psychiatric disorder characterised by frequent panic attacks, is the most common anxiety disorder, affecting 2 to 6% of the general population. No one line of treatment has been found to be superior, making a risk-benefit assessment of the treatments available useful for treating patients. Choice of treatment depends on a number of issues, including the adverse effect profile, efficacy and the presence of concomitant syndromes. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are beneficial in the treatment of panic disorder. They have a proven efficacy, are affordable and are conveniently administered. Adverse effects, including jitteriness syndrome, bodyweight gain, anticholinergic effects and orthostatic hypotension are commonly associated with TCAs, but can be managed successfully. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) reuptake inhibitors are also potential first line agents and are well tolerated and effective, with a favourable adverse effects profile. There is little risk in overdose or of anticholinergic effects. Adverse effects include sedation, dyspepsia and headache early in treatment, and sexual dysfunction and increased anxiety, but these can be effectively managed with proper dosage escalation and management. Benzodiazepines are an effective treatment, providing short-term relief of panic-related symptoms. Patients respond to treatment quickly, providing rapid relief of symptoms. Adverse effects include ataxia and drowsiness, and cognitive and psycho-motor impairment. There are reservations over their first-line use because of concerns regarding abuse and dependence. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, because of their adverse effects profile, potential drug interactions, dietary restrictions, gradual onset of effect and overdose risk, are not considered to be first-line agents. They are effective however, and should be considered for patients with refractory disease. Valproic acid (valproate sodium), while not intensively studied, shows potential for use in panic disorder. More studies are needed in this area before the available data can be confirmed. As a supplement to drug therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy is effective.

Patients who were improved at 6 weeks could volunteer to continue double-blind treatment for a total of 24 weeks. The maintenance treatment phase allowed the comparison of taper results for the three treatments at several study periods (0-6 weeks, 7-12 weeks, and more than 12 weeks). Slightly more diazepam (77%) and placebo (75%) patients completed the 6-week study than abecarnil patients (66%). At intake and baseline, after a 1-week placebo washout, the patient was required to have a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score of > or =20. Major adverse events for both abecarnil and diazepam were drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, and coordination difficulties. Clinical improvement data showed that both abecarnil and diazepam produced statistically significantly more symptom relief than did placebo after 1 week of treatment. At 6 weeks treatment (using last observation carried forward analysis), however, only diazepam still differed significantly (p < 0.01) from placebo. High placebo response (56% moderate to marked global improvement) at 6 weeks, as well as a slightly lower nonsignificant improvement rate observed with abecarnil, a partial y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist, when compared with diazepam, a full GABA agonist, most likely contributed to our findings. Finally, taper results showed that only diazepam and not abecarnil caused the presence of temporary discontinuation symptoms, but only in patients who had been treated for at least 12 weeks.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Analysis of Variance, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*administration & dosage, Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy, Carbolines/*administration & dosage, Diazepam/*administration & dosage, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Placebos",-1
8018750,Basic and clinical studies of pharmacologic effects on recovery from brain injury.,Goldstein LB,J Neural Transplant Plast. 1993 Jul-Sep;4(3):175-92.,"Investigations in laboratory animals indicate that certain drugs that influence specific neurotransmitters can have profound effects on the recovery process. Even small doses of some drugs given after brain injury facilitate recovery while others are harmful. Preliminary clinical studies suggest that the same drugs that enhance recovery in laboratory animals (e.g., amphetamine) may have similar effects in humans after stroke. In addition, some of the drugs that impair recovery of function after focal brain injury in laboratory animals (e.g. haloperidol, benzodiazepines, clonidine, prazosin, phenytoin) are commonly given to stroke patients for coincident medical problems and may interfere with functional recovery in humans. Until the impact of pharmacologic agents on the recovering brain is better understood, the available data suggest that care should be exercised in the selection of drugs used in the treatment of the recovering stroke patient. Pharmacologic enhancement of recovery after focal brain injury may be possible in humans.","Animals, Brain Injuries/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Humans",-1

There have been major advances in research in recovery over the last decade, including new information on the mechanics and genetics of metabolism and chemical activity, the definition of excitotoxic effects and the discovery that the brain itself secretes complex proteins, peptides and hormones which are capable of directly stimulating the repair of damaged neurons or blocking some of the degenerative processes caused by the injury cascade. Many of these agents, plus other nontoxic naturally occurring substances, are being tested as treatment for brain injury. Further work is needed to determine appropriate combinations of treatments and optimum times of administration with respect to the time course of the CNS disorder. In order to understand the mechanisms that mediate traumatic brain injury and repair, there must be a merging of findings from neurochemical studies with data from intensive behavioral testing.","Animals, Brain Chemistry/drug effects/physiology, Brain Injuries/*drug therapy/physiopathology/rehabilitation, Humans, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use",-1

Computerized data (MediPlus, IMS Health) were analyzed in 4,636 male and 16,573 female migraineurs from 383 primary care practices 1994 through 1996 (Primary Care of Migraine, PCAOM study). A total of 90,540 drug prescriptions with a documented diagnosis of migraine were issued in 45,669 person-years (1,492 prescriptions [DM 40.99] per person-year to men, 2,109 prescriptions [DM 62.01] per person-year to women). Approximately three of every four prescriptions were incompatible with the recommendations of the German Migraine and Headache Society (DMKG), amounting to extrapolated costs of DM 49 million per year borne by the German statutory health insurance fund for combination migraine preparations. The density of non-DMKG therapies for diagnosed migraine followed a sigmoid curve with increasing patient age, while DMKG-compliant therapies described a bell-shaped curve. Referrals to neurological care specialists were not associated with subsequent primary care focus on recommended therapies. We conclude that medication prescribed for migraine is largely not according to long-standing recommendations by medical societies in Germany.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Analgesics/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Costs and Cost Analysis, Drug Costs/statistics & numerical data, Drug Prescriptions/economics/*statistics & numerical data, Drug Utilization/economics, Female, Germany, Humans, Infant, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy/economics, National Health Programs/economics, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Primary Health Care/economics",-1

It has antimanic effects but, as its potential clinical usefulness and tolerability in broad samples of psychiatric patients remain to be tested, we reviewed both the pharmacology of oxcarbazepine and our early experience with this new agent among psychiatric inpatients. METHODS: We reviewed medical records of all inpatients given oxcarbazepine in the first 15 months of its use at McLean Hospital. Data analyzed included dosing, presenting illnesses, other medications, clinical changes, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Oxcarbazepine was given to 56 inpatients (1.3% of admissions; 31 women, 25 men) presenting with depression (n = 23), mania (n = 19), or psychosis (n = 14). The discharge daily dose for the 43 patients (76%) taking oxcarbazepine was 831 mg/day, 34% higher in men than women, and fell by 9 mg/year-of-age. Oxcarbazepine was the only putative mood-stabilizing agent given at discharge in 19 of 43 cases (44%). It was discontinued in 20% of patients for apparent inefficacy, and 4% for adverse effects. Changes in CGI and GAF scores were similarly high across illnesses, and unrelated to days of use of oxcarbazepine or its dose. CONCLUSIONS: Oxcarbazepine was well tolerated and simpler to use clinically than its precursor carbamazepine. This agent should be studied in controlled trials to test its efficacy in specific types of major psychiatric disorders, and particularly for long-term maintenance treatment in bipolar disorder.","Age Factors, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy, Carbamazepine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Inpatients, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Retrospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

Although various modalities exist to treat pediatric-onset seizures, seizures in 25% of children who are diagnosed as having epilepsy remain refractory to available therapies. Of the 8 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and zonisamide), all but 2 (zonisamide and levetiracetam) have received Food and Drug Administration approval for adjunctive use in the pediatric population. However, most of the new AEDs used in adults have also been used in children, beyond the AEDs' approved indications. The ultimate goal of patient management is to choose the therapeutic option that provides the best chance of improving the patient's quality of life. Issues that relate to treatment choice include the likelihood of seizure recurrence, type and severity of seizures, available AED efficacies and toxicities, need for hematologic monitoring, ease of dosing, underlying medical conditions, medication interactions, urgency of initiating therapy, and cost. In this review, we discuss these issues for each of the 8 new AEDs; we also discuss the ketogenic diet and briefly review the older AEDs. Knowledge of the available AEDs will enable the practitioner to choose the best drug or drugs for individual patients.","Anticonvulsants/*therapeutic use, Child, Epilepsy/*diet therapy/*drug therapy, Humans, Ketone Bodies/*metabolism",-1

Diclofenac, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug, is widely used to treat acute and chronic pain but there are few reports of its use given rectally in children undergoing strabismus surgery. This open randomised study was designed to investigate the analgesic and anti-emetic properties of rectally administered diclofenac compared with opioid (morphine) given i.v. in connection with strabismus surgery in children. METHODS: After obtaining approval from the local ethics committee and written informed consent from the parents, 50 ASA class I-II children, 4-16 years of age, were randomised to receive either rectally administered diclofenac (Voltaren) 1 mg/kg or i.v. opioid (morphine) 0.05 mg/kg perioperatively. The children were consecutively operated upon from May 1999 to January 2001. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained with propofol. Nitrous oxide was omitted. The postoperative pain was assessed after arrival at the post anaesthesia care unit (PACU) by using the validated Wong and Baker scale (FACES) Pain Rating Scale. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was assessed by measuring the frequency of vomiting and the degree of nausea. RESULTS: In the diclofenac group the incidence of PONV during the first 24 h was 12% (of which one child had severe vomiting). The incidence of PONV was much higher, 72% (P = 0.0000), in the morphine group, where 56% of the children also had severe vomiting. There were no difference in pain score between the two groups. Recovery time at the PACU was longer (P < 0.002) and the postoperative analgesic requirement higher in the morphine group (10 vs. 5 children). No children needed overnight admission to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Diclofenac given rectally is an effective analgesic for this kind of surgery and gives less postoperative nausea than i.v. morphine. No serious adverse events were observed.","Administration, Rectal, Adolescent, Ambulatory Surgical Procedures, Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Diclofenac/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Injections, Intravenous, Male, Morphine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, *Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures, Pain Measurement/drug effects, Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting/*prevention & control, Strabismus/*surgery",-1
7897521,A comparison of intrathecally administered narcotic and nonnarcotic analgesics for experimental chronic neuropathic pain.,"Leiphart JW, Dills CV, Zikel OM, Kim DL, Levy RM",J Neurosurg. 1995 Apr;82(4):595-9.,"The antinociceptive actions of morphine and tizanidine (an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist) administered intrathecally in a rat model of mononeuropathic pain were investigated. Tizanidine increased to normal levels the intensity of a noxious pressure stimulus required to induce paw withdrawal (p < 0.01) and decreased the duration of limb withdrawal from both normal-temperature and cooled floors in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Tizanidine had virtually no effect on the latency of paw withdrawal from a noxious heat stimulus. In comparison, morphine significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, limb withdrawal from the normal-temperature and cooled floors and increased to cutoff values the withdrawal latencies of both noxious heat and pressure stimuli (p < 0.01). The effect of tizanidine was limited to the hyperalgesic limb and served to normalize reactive latencies, whereas morphine affected both hindlimbs and increased latencies to supranormal cutoff values. These data suggest that intrathecal tizanidine may be more specific than morphine in reversing the allodynia and hyperpathia associated with neuropathic pain states and may be of value in the management of patients with these clinical syndromes.","Analgesics/*administration & dosage, Animals, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Morphine/*administration & dosage, Nerve Compression Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy, Pain/*drug therapy/etiology, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Reaction Time/drug effects, *Sciatic Nerve/surgery",-1

This approach has also been used successfully in cases with spasticity of supraspinal origin. To achieve a good therapeutic response in the latter condition the amount of intrathecal baclofen has to be approximately twice the dosage required in spinal spasticity. We report on 8 patients suffering from supraspinal spasticity due to severe traumatic brain injury. Intrathecal baclofen reduced spasticity in all patients (mean Ashworth Score from 3.9 to 1.6; mean Reflex Score from 4.0 to 1.4). In some cases improvement of motor performance and in one case recovery of bladder function were noted. In two patients focal epileptic seizures with secondary generalization seemed to be associated with the application of baclofen.

The cause of the condition is unknown but the finding of antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in approximately 60% of patients has suggested an autoimmune basis. Pathological findings are limited to a small number of cases which are reviewed in this paper. In some, evidence of an inflammatory aetiology has been found, and there appears to be overlap with progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity (PER) which may present with a similar clinical picture. The spontaneous muscle activity in SMS and PER is of central origin, related to release of polysynaptic spinal and brainstem reflexes. The SMS is readily distinguished from the continuous muscle activity, spasm and cramps of Isaac's syndrome and neuromyotonia which originate in the peripheral nervous system. Fasciculations, myokymia, myotonia and complex repetitive discharges are characteristic of these peripheral neuromuscular disorders.","Encephalomyelitis/complications, Humans, Muscle Rigidity/*etiology, Spasm/*etiology, Stiff-Person Syndrome/*etiology/immunology/physiopathology",-1

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search was conducted from January 1980 to August 2000. Keywords included intensive care, head injury, subarachnoid haemorrhage, status epilepticus, myasthenic crisis, Guillain-Barre syndrome and stroke. All articles in English were considered for review. Additional articles were identified from the references of the retrieved articles and cross-referencing selected articles. DATA EXTRACTION: All clinical studies, review articles and abstracts were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Rapid advances in neurological and neurosurgical intensive care in the last decade have led to the development of specialised neurointensive care units with joint ventures between neurology and neurosurgery. Work in these units have contributed immensely to our understanding of the pathophysiology and management of acute brain injury. The principles of intensive care management include amelioration or reversal of brain injury and preservation of normal neural tissue. Treatment algorithms are possible with the aid of intense clinical and neurophysiologic monitoring. Ongoing clinical and basic science research may provide new treatment options for the intensivist in the acute phase of brain injury. CONCLUSION: Specialised neurointensive care units provide the best environment for the patient with acute brain injury. Outcome is frequently enhanced the clinicians skilled towards dealing with the whole spectrum of neurologic insults.","Humans, Intensive Care/*organization & administration, Intensive Care Units/organization & administration, Nervous System Diseases/*therapy, Neurology/*organization & administration, Neurosurgery/*organization & administration",-1

Of the 140 patients assessed, 7 met the following criteria for inclusion in the study: a modified Ashworth score > 3, a spasm frequency score > 2, and an inadequate response to oral anti-spasticity drugs, (i.e., baclofen, clonidine and cyproheptadine). All patients responded to intrathecal bolus injection of baclofen in the double blind, placebo-controlled screening phase (mean bolus dose = 42.8 micrograms). Programmable Medtronic pumps were implanted in 4 patients while 3 patients received non-programmable Infusaid pumps. Post-implantation, a marked decrease in spasticity occurred with a significant reduction of the Ashworth score (mean = 1.8, p < .005), a reduced spasm score (mean = 0.8, p < .005), and an improved leg swing in the pendulum test. These effects were maintained during a follow-up of 24-41 months (average infusion dose = 218.7 micrograms/day). The gross cost-savings due to reduced hospitalizations related to spasticity was calculated by comparing the cost for the two year period before pump implantation to the same period after treatment for 6 of the 7 patients. The cost of in-hospital implantation as well as the cost of the pumps were deducted from the gross savings. There was a net cost-saving of $153,120. Our findings agree with the reported efficacy and safety of intrathecal baclofen treatment, and illustrate the cost-effectiveness of this treatment.","Adult, Baclofen/*pharmacology, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Hospitalization, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Kinetics, Knee, Male, Middle Aged, Respiratory Function Tests, Spinal Cord Injuries/*therapy",-1

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of gabapentin on neuropathic pain refractory to conventional analgesics in patients with spinal cord injury and different durations of symptoms. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury severely compromises their quality of life. Gabapentin is a new antiepileptic drug that may additionally have a role in the treatment of neuropathic pain. So far, there has been little prospective research investigating the effect of gabapentin on neuropathic pain in patients after spinal cord injury or comparing gabapentin-treated patients with varying durations of symptoms after spinal cord injury. METHODS: The study included 31 patients who had experienced neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury or cauda equina syndrome. These subjects were divided into two groups. Group 1 (n = 13) was composed of patients whose duration of pain was less than 6 months, and Group 2 (n = 18) comprised patients whose symptoms of neuropathic pain had lasted more than 6 months. Although these patients had been treated with conventional analgesics such as antidepressants, anticonvulsants, membrane stabilizer, and neuroleptics, they reported that their condition did not improve after a medication trial of at least 2 weeks duration. In this study, conventional analgesics were continued at a therapeutic level, and gabapentin was administrated for an 18-day titration period followed by a 5-week maintenance period at a dosage of 1800 mg/day or the maximum tolerable dosage. The efficacy of gabapentin administration was gauged by a pain score and a sleep interference score using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) every 2 weeks. The scores of the two groups were compared every 2 weeks over the course of the 8-week study. RESULTS: The mean pain score and the mean sleep interference score for Group 1 decreased more than that of Group 2 during the interval between 2 to 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The mean pain score for Group 1 decreased from 7.3 +/- 0.5 initially to 3 +/- 0.6 after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas the corresponding score for Group 2 decreased from 7.6 +/- 0.4 to 5.1 +/- 0.6 ( < 0.05). The mean sleep interference score for Group 1 decreased from 5.7 +/- 0.9 initially to 1.8 +/- 0.8 after 8 weeks of treatment, whereas the corresponding score for Group 2 decreased from 5.9 +/- 0.8 to 4.2 +/- 0.7 (P < 0.05). As compared with the onset of this study, a decrease in pain score of 2 or more was reported at the completion of this study for 11 patients (100%) in Group 1 and 10 (71%) of 14 patients in Group 2. A decrease of 2 or more in sleep interference scores was reported for 8 (89%) of 9 patients with sleep interference in Group 1 and for 8 (62%) of 13 patients with sleep interference in Group 2. Some adverse effects such as somnolence were noted, but they were mild or moderate in intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin may be effective in decreasing neuropathic pain refractory to conventional analgesics in some patients with spinal cord injury whose duration of symptoms is less than 6 months, although those with duration of symptoms longer than 6 months showed a significant decrease as well. The drug is unlikely to cause serious adverse effects that limit its use in patients with spinal cord injury.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Amines, Analgesics/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuralgia/etiology/*prevention & control, Pain Measurement, Polyradiculopathy/*complications, Sleep/drug effects, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
12603635,Migraine preventive medication reduces resource utilization.,"Silberstein SD, Winner PK, Chmiel JJ",Headache. 2003 Mar;43(3):171-8.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if long-term resource utilization is reduced by adding a preventive medication to a migraine management regimen that already includes acute medication. BACKGROUND: In 2000, new evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of migraine were released by the US Headache Consortium and the American Academy of Neurology. Although these guidelines emphasize the role of preventive medication in achieving significant clinical improvement, little yet is known concerning the impact of such management on medical and pharmaceutical resources. Methods.-Resource utilization information in a large claims database was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Adding a preventive medication to migraine management reduced the use of other migraine medications, as well as visits to physician offices and emergency departments. In addition, both acute and preventive medications were associated with lower utilization of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. CONCLUSION: Migraine preventive drug therapy is effective in reducing resource consumption when added to therapy consisting only of an acute medication.","Amitriptyline/economics/*therapeutic use, Cohort Studies, Health Resources/*utilization, Humans, Migraine Disorders/drug therapy/economics/*prevention & control, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Retrospective Studies, Serotonin Receptor Agonists/economics/therapeutic use, Sumatriptan/economics/therapeutic use, United States, Valproic Acid/economics/*therapeutic use",-1

12218520,A randomized study of the effects of single-dose gabapentin versus placebo on postoperative pain and morphine consumption after mastectomy.,"Dirks J, Fredensborg BB, Christensen D, Fomsgaard JS, Flyger H, Dahl JB",Anesthesiology. 2002 Sep;97(3):560-4.,"BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsant gabapentin has proven effective for neuropathic pain in three large placebo-controlled clinical trials. Experimental and clinical studies have demonstrated antihyperalgesic effects in models involving central neuronal sensitization. It has been suggested that central neuronal sensitization may play an important role in postoperative pain. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of gabapentin on morphine consumption and postoperative pain in patients undergoing radical mastectomy. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 70 patients received a single dose of oral gabapentin (1,200 mg) or placebo 1 h before surgery. Patients received patient-controlled analgesia with morphine at doses of 2.5 mg with a lock-out time of 10 min for 4 h postoperatively. Pain was assessed on a visual analog scale at rest and during movement, and side effects were assessed on a four-point verbal scale 2 and 4 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients in the gabapentin group and 34 patients in the placebo group completed the study. Gabapentin reduced total morphine consumption from a median of 29 (interquartile range, 21-33) to 15 (10-19) mg (P< 0.0001). Pain during movement was reduced from 41 (31-59) to 22 (10-38) mm at 2 h postoperatively (P < 0.0001) and from 31 (12-40) to 9 (3-34) mm at 4 h postoperatively (P = 0.018). No significant differences between groups were observed with regard to pain at rest or side effects. CONCLUSION: A single dose of 1,200 mg oral gabapentin resulted in a substantial reduction in postoperative morphine consumption and movement-related pain after radical mastectomy, without significant side effects. These promising results should be validated in other acute pain models involving central neuronal sensitization.","Acetates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Aged, *Amines, Analgesics/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, *Mastectomy, Middle Aged, Morphine/*therapeutic use, Pain Measurement/drug effects, Pain, Postoperative/*drug therapy/psychology, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
12492607,Quinine pharmacokinetics in chronic haemodialysis patients.,"Roy L, Bannon P, Villeneuve JP",Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2002 Dec;54(6):604-9.,"AIMS: Quinine is often used to prevent muscle cramps in patients with chronic renal failure. A standard dose of 300 mg at bedtime is usually recommended, but little is known about the pharmacokinetics of quinine in the presence of renal failure. METHODS: We studied the pharmacokinetics of quinine in eight normal subjects and eight patients with chronic renal failure on haemodialysis after a single oral dose of quinine sulphate (300 mg). RESULTS: The concentration of alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG), the major binding protein for quinine, was increased in haemodialysis patients compared with control subjects (1.52 g l-1 vs 0.63 g l-1 [mean difference 1.033; 95% CI 0.735, 1.330]) whereas albumin levels were decreased (30 g l-1 vs 40 g l-1 [mean difference 9.5; 95% CI 3.048, 15.952]). Accordingly, the free fraction of quinine was decreased (0.024 vs 0.063 [mean difference 0.0380; 95% CI 0.0221, 0.0539]) and the apparent volume of distribution tended to decrease (0.95 l kg-1 vs 1.43 l kg-1 [mean difference 0.480; 95% CI 0.193, 1.154]). The quinine binding ratio correlated with the plasma concentration of AAG but not that of albumin. The clearance of free (unbound) quinine was increased in haemodialysis patients compared with controls (67.9 ml min-1 kg-1 vs 41.1 ml min-1 kg-1 [mean difference -26.8; 95% CI, -56.994, 3.469]), and the area under the curve (AUC) of the two main metabolites, 3-hydroxyquinine and 10,11-dihydroxydihydroquinine were increased. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic renal failure, there is an increase in plasma protein binding and in the clearance of free drug, resulting in lower plasma concentration of free quinine.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Aged, Area Under Curve, Female, Humans, Kidney Failure, Chronic/*metabolism, Male, Metabolic Clearance Rate, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Orosomucoid/analysis, Quinidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, Quinine/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics, Quinones/pharmacokinetics, *Renal Dialysis",-1

11442324,Clinical characteristics and management of ALS.,"Borasio GD, Miller RG",Semin Neurol. 2001 Jun;21(2):155-66.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of degenerative motor neuron disease in adulthood. The clinical picture was accurately described by Charcot over 125 years ago and consists of generalized fasciculations, progressive atrophy and weakness of the skeletal muscles, spasticity and pyramidal tract signs, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dyspnea. Pseudobulbar affect is common. Disease-specific treatment options are still unsatisfactory. However, therapeutic nihilism is not justified as a large array of palliative measures is available to enhance the quality of life of patients and their families. Palliative care in ALS is a multidisciplinary effort requiring careful coordination. An open and frank disclosure of the diagnosis is of paramount importance. Nutritional deficiency due to pronounced dysphagia can be relieved by a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. Respiratory insufficiency can be effectively treated by noninvasive home mechanical ventilation. The terminal phase of the disease should be discussed, at the latest, when symptoms of dyspnea appear in order to prevent unwarranted fears of ""choking to death.""

METHODS: We report a 37-year-old man who had recurrent EM eruptions following sun exposures over a period of 20 years. Lesions were prevalently located on exposed skin, but unexposed skin and mucosa of the oropharynx were also affected. The patient had poor tolerance to sunlight and denied having herpes simplex infection or using drugs. RESULTS: Provocative phototest induced clinically and histologically similar lesions at low dose thresholds of UVA (10 J/cm2) and UVB (100 mJ/cm2).

Comparison of action, adverse effects and acceptance by gynecologic inpatients].","Heim C, Munzer T, Listyo R",Anaesthesist. 1994 Aug;43(8):504-9.,"INTRODUCTION: Ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), but it has not been proved to be superior to established antiemetics for prophylaxis or therapy. We compared ondansetron vs droperidol for the treatment of PONV. METHODS: Our prospective, randomized double-blind study was performed between 15 October 1992 and July 1993; it included 271 gynaecological ASA I-III inpatients who had been operated on under general anaesthesia with intubation. Patients were excluded if: there was no informed consent; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding; allergies were being treated with antihistamines; drug addiction was present or convulsions or Parkinson's disease; any pre- or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered. All patients wishing an antiemetic and/or suffering from at least one emetic episode during the first 24 h postoperatively received either 8 mg ondansetron or 1.25 mg droperidol from identical 4 ml ampoules intravenously. The verbal nausea score (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe) was recorded every 30 min for 4 h, then before and 2 h after each antiemetic dose. All emetic episodes and the interval between administration and effect were also noted. Patients were interviewed 36-48 h postoperatively on subjective effects, side-effects and individual acceptance. After oral premedication with diazepam, anaesthesia was induced with thiopental, in a few cases with etomidate or propofol. Relaxation was achieved with pancuronium or atracurium and, when indicated, with succinylcholine. Muscular relaxation was antagonized with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate. Gastric content was aspirated once after intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen, enflurane, halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0.3 mg. Statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Categoric variables were examined by the chi 2 test. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Of 271 patients, 100 (37%) experienced PONV. The groups were statistically comparable with respect to demographic data, type and duration of operation, emesis record, perioperative uterotonic medication. Twenty patients in the ondansetron group and 27 in the droperidol group received the first antiemetic within 2 h, the other patients up to 17 h after extubation. Nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before antiemetic medication. The reduction of these parameters after medication was similar. Complete response over 6 h was 60% in the ondansetron and 68% in the droperidol group. In both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during the initial 2 h. Twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients needed a second dose; among these 2 and 4, respectively, a third ampoule. No rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1.4 ampoules was administered in both groups. Onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups. It was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to linguistic or amnestic problems. Multiple side-effects were noted frequently. Injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol, pruritus in the ondansetron group. Ninety-three percent of the ondansetron and 85% of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future PONV treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Ondansetron (8 mg) and droperidol (1.25 mg) proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic. Both drugs showed similar side-effects. Due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Double-Blind Method, Droperidol/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Female, Genitalia, Female/surgery, Humans, Middle Aged, Nausea/*drug therapy, Ondansetron/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Patient Acceptance of Health Care, Postoperative Complications/*drug therapy, Prospective Studies, Vomiting/*drug therapy",-1

Spasticity can be dramatically reduced by the continuous infusion of baclofen into the lumbar subarachnoid space using a drug delivery system. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of reduced spasticity on quality of life using intrathecal baclofen therapy. Twenty-five patients with intractable spasticity treated with intrathecal baclofen participated in this prospective study. Spasticity was measured using the Ashworth and spasm scales. Quality of life was measured using the Ferrans and Powers Quality of Life Index (QLI) and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP). The mean spasm score decreased significantly from 2.6 at baseline to 0.5 after one year (Friedman test; p = 0.000017). The mean Ashworth score decreased significantly from 3.78 at baseline to 1.48 after one year, (Friedman test; p = 0.00000014). Though total QLI scores were not significantly different when comparing baseline with one year, the SIP revealed significant changes in the total score as well as the physical and psychosocial subscales. It is likely the QLI did not demonstrate improvement in quality of life due to the emphasis of this tool on nonphysical domains. A qualitative analysis of two open-ended questions revealed positive statements about the change in quality of life when spasticity is well-controlled. Measuring changes in quality of life after specific interventions is a difficult task, requiring an accurate operational definition of the concept and valid instruments for measurement.","Adult, Aged, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Infusions, Parenteral, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/etiology/*psychology, Nursing Methodology Research, Prospective Studies, *Quality of Life, Sickness Impact Profile, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, *Spine",-1

DESIGN AND SETTING: A postal survey was conducted in the community. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 471 persons aged 18 years or older who had spinal cord injuries and pain. There were 2 separate samples (n = 308 and n = 163). OUTCOME MEASURES: The pain treatments used, the helpfulness of these treatments, and the Chronic Pain Grade questionnaire answers were assessed. RESULTS: Respondents reported multiple pain treatments (range of 0-14 and median of 4 in sample 1; range of 0-16 and median of 4 in sample 2). The most commonly reported treatments were oral medications and physical therapy. Medication types most commonly reported were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and opioids. The treatments rated as most helpful were opioid medications, physical therapy, and diazepam therapy, and those rated as least helpful were spinal cord stimulation, counseling or psychotherapy, administration of acetaminophen, and administration of amitriptyline. Alternative treatments reported as most helpful were massage therapy and use of marijuana. Acupuncture was tried by many but was rated as only moderately helpful.

The aim of this randomized double blind, dose-ranging study was to determine the minimum single effective dose of dexamethasone combined with ondansetron for the prevention of PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: One hundred eighty patients were allocated randomly to one of six groups to receive saline (P group), ondansetron 4 mg (O group), or ondansetron 4 mg and dexamethasone at doses of 2 mg (OD2 group), 4 mg (OD4 group), 8 mg (OD8 group), and 16 mg (OD16 group). A standardized general anesthetic was used. All episodes of PONV during the intervals of zero to six hours, 6-12 hr and 12-24 hr after surgery were evaluated using a numeric scoring system. Mean visual analogue scale pain scores at rest and on movement, the time to first demand of analgesia, total analgesic consumption in 12 hr epochs, duration of hospital stay, and side effects were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of PONV in the OD8 (16%) and OD16 (16%) groups was lower than in the 83% (P < 0.001) and O groups (50%) at the 12-24 hr epoch (P < 0.05). There were no differences in antiemetic effect between the O, OD2 and OD4 groups and between the OD8 and OD16 groups. Pain scores, total analgesic consumption, duration of hospital stay and side effects were similar among groups.

Spasticity does not always cause harm and can assist in the rehabilitation process enabling a patient to stand when their limb weakness would not otherwise allow it. When it does cause harm, however, treatment is required. This aims to (i) prevent provocative factors (ii) treat muscle overactivity; and (iii) prevent complications. Untreated, limb contracture, pain and other complications occur and early management can be most effective. Treatment is essentially physical, but, when this is inadequate, pharmacological intervention may be required. A strategy has been devised which shows that the first choice pharmacological treatment of focal spasticity is botulinum toxin. Over the past decade, the choice of treatment has become more ambitious with the establishment of new technologies. Good management now depends on an understanding of their role and application in relation to the needs of individual patients. To this end, a treatment algorithm which covers the salient facts in patient assessment and gives the indications for the range of available treatments, is the best approach. The indications and limitations of the available treatments are discussed, along with their place in the overall management of the patients. The evidence base for much of what is done is not strong and this summary examines the activities of proven value and of consensus view.","Algorithms, Botulinum Toxins/therapeutic use, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/diagnosis/etiology/*therapy, Neuromuscular Agents/therapeutic use, Physical Therapy Modalities",-1

9728835,"Intrathecal, but not intravenous, clonidine reduces experimental thermal or capsaicin-induced pain and hyperalgesia in normal volunteers.","Eisenach JC, Hood DD, Curry R",Anesth Analg. 1998 Sep;87(3):591-6.,"Clonidine is approved for intraspinal administration in the treatment of neuropathic cancer pain. Some studies have suggested an analgesic effect after systemic clonidine administration. The purpose of this study was to compare the analgesic effects of intrathecal and IV clonidine with acute noxious stimulation and with hyperalgesia from intradermal capsaicin injection in volunteers. Sixteen healthy volunteers received intradermal injections of capsaicin (100 microg) before and after the IV or intrathecal injection of clonidine 50 or 150 microg in a randomized, double-blind manner. Pain and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia were determined at specified intervals. In addition, pain to noxious heat stimulation was determined. The capsaicin injection produced pain, followed by hyperalgesia and allodynia. The intrathecal, but not IV, injection of 150 microg of clonidine reduced capsaicin-induced pain and area of hyperalgesia. Intrathecal clonidine (150 microg) reduced pain to heat stimulation, whereas IV clonidine did not. The groups did not differ in hemodynamic or sedative effects from clonidine. These data support the value of intraspinal administration of clonidine for the treatment of acute pain and of pain states associated with hyperalgesia. Similarly, they suggest that analgesia from the systemic administration of this alpha2-adrenergic agonist, if any, is weak in doses that produce sedation and reduce blood pressure. IMPLICATIONS: To the extent that the experimental pain conditions used in this study reflect those in patients with acute and chronic pain, these data support the spinal rather than IV injection of clonidine for analgesia.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Adult, Analgesics/*pharmacology, Blood Pressure/drug effects, *Capsaicin, Clonidine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology, Double-Blind Method, Female, Heart Rate/drug effects, Hot Temperature/*adverse effects, Humans, Hyperalgesia/*chemically induced/pathology, Injections, Intravenous, Injections, Spinal, Male, Pain/chemically induced/*drug therapy",-1

The clinical presentation includes seizures, headache, altered mental status and blindness. Disturbed autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and endothelial injury are central to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Prompt control of hypertension results in rapid and complete neurological recovery. In this report we discuss the cases of two children with acute onset hypertension of different aetiologies that presented with the characteristic features of posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of this readily treatable condition may obviate the need for extensive and invasive investigations.

This review summarises new treatment options both for the therapy of the acute attack as well as for migraine prophylaxis. Analgesics like aspirin or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in treating migraine attacks. Few controlled trials were performed for the use of ergotamine or dihydroergotamine. These trials indicate inferior efficacy compared to serotonin (5-HT)1B/D-agonists (further on called ""triptans""). The triptans (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan) are highly effective. They improve headache as well as nausea, photo- and phonophobia. The different triptans have minor differences in efficacy, headache recurrence and adverse effects. The knowledge of their different pharmacological profile allows a more specific treatment of the individual migraine characteristics. Migraine prophylaxis is recommended, when more than 3 attacks occur per month, if attacks do not respond to acute treatment or if side effects of acute treatment are severe. Substances with proven efficacy include the beta-blockers metoprolol and propranolol, the calcium channel blocker flunarizine, several 5-HT antagonists and amitriptyline. Recently antiepileptic drugs (valproic acid, gabapentin, topiramate) were evaluated for the prophylaxis of migraine. The use of botulinum-toxin is under investigation.","Adrenergic beta-Antagonists/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Calcium Channel Blockers/therapeutic use, Humans, Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy, Vasoconstrictor Agents/*therapeutic use",-1

A historico-epidemiological approach: part II.,Kissler H,Med Hypotheses. 2001 Sep;57(3):292-301.,"The comparison between the old map of malaria and the later distribution of multiple sclerosis (MS) first carried out in the USA (Part I) is continued in Europe. The Italian 'dilemma' (Kurtzke), meaning the disappearance of the north-south gradient in Italy by recent surveys, can be solved when considering the dependence of malaria transmission in relation to the altitude. Further, the high prevalence of MS in earlier times in Mississippi, Louisiana and in the former province of Lucania in Italy can be explained by preceding epidemics of malaria. Brickner's therapeutic trial with quinine in cases of MS patients is reevaluated, and by this the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is shown to exist in MS too. The possible significance of the old and rather forgotten provocative methods for the diagnosis of latent malaria is discussed.","Altitude, Animals, Antibodies, Protozoan/blood, Europe, Humans, Incidence, Malaria/*complications/physiopathology, Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/*parasitology/physiopathology, Plasmodium/immunology/isolation & purification, Prevalence, Quinine/therapeutic use, United States",-1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two RDC bipolar 1 and II patients were assessed by means of the SADS and entered if they gave their consent to participate. All them had suffered from frequent relapses, subsyndromal features (mostly depressive) and incomplete response to other drugs. They all received open-label increasing doses of gabapentin until clinical response. The patients were assessed through the CGI-BP and a specific questionnaire at baseline and at 12 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: Six out of the 22 patients dropped out for various reasons (four because of relapse, one because of side effects and one more because of poor compliance). Eight of the 16 patients that completed the 12-week follow-up showed at least two stages of improvement in the CGI. Using the last observation-carried forward analysis, the improvement was statistically significant for the depression subscale, and apparently related to social functioning, irritability and anxiety. Only one patient dropped out because of intolerance (mild rash). The mean dose of gabapentin was 1,310 mg/day. CONCLUSION: Gabapentin may be a useful drug for the add-on treatment of bipolar patients with poor response to other mood stabilizers. Gabapentin may improve depressive residual symptoms such as irritability, social withdrawal or anxiety. These results should be confirmed in randomized clinical trials.","Acetates/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Adult, *Amines, Anticonvulsants/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Antimanic Agents/*therapeutic use, Bipolar Disorder/*drug therapy/psychology, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Drug Therapy, Combination, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1
11336578,Pharmacology and clinical experience with tiagabine.,Schachter SC,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2001 Jan;2(1):179-87.,"Tiagabine (TGB), a recently approved anti-epileptic drug (AED), has a specific and unique mechanism of action involving the inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) re-uptake into neurones and glia. TGB is potent and has linear and predictable pharmacokinetics. It does not induce or inhibit hepatic metabolism and has no clinically significant effects on the serum concentrations of other AEDs or commonly used non-AEDs. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in primarily hepatic enzyme-induced patients showed that TGB 30 - 56 mg/day is an effective add-on treatment for all subtypes of partial seizures. The most common adverse effects in the trials were dizziness, asthenia (weakness), somnolence, accidental injury, infection, headache, nausea and nervousness. These side effects were usually mild to moderate in severity and generally did not require medical intervention. Long-term safety studies show continued efficacy of TGB over time and no evidence of tolerance for efficacy. Open studies confirm that patients with medically refractory partial epilepsy can be successfully converted to TGB monotherapy and that TGB may be effective for other seizure types, such as infantile spasms.","Biological Availability, Cross-Over Studies, Double-Blind Method, Epilepsy/*drug therapy, GABA Agonists/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Humans, Multicenter Studies as Topic, Nipecotic Acids/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1

METHODS: This meta-analysis of 49 fibromyalgia treatment outcome studies assessed the efficacy of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment across four types of outcome measures-physical status, self-report of FMS symptoms, psychological status, and daily functioning. RESULTS: After controlling for study design, antidepressants resulted in improvements on physical status and self-report of FMS symptoms. All nonpharmacological treatments were associated with significant improvements in all four categories of outcome measures with the exception that physically-based treatment (primarily exercise) did not significantly improve daily functioning. When compared, nonpharmacological treatment appears to be more efficacious in improving self-report of FMS symptoms than pharmacological treatment alone. A similar trend was suggested for functional measures. CONCLUSION: The optimal intervention for FMS would include nonpharmacological treatments, specifically exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, in addition to appropriate medication management as needed for sleep and pain symptoms.","Activities of Daily Living, *Exercise, Fibromyalgia/drug therapy/psychology/*therapy, Health Status, Humans, Outcome Assessment (Health Care)/methods, Psychotherapy/*methods, Psychotropic Drugs/*therapeutic use",1

Efficacy of intrathecal baclofen for spasticity of spinal origin has been well established and has shown promise in treatment of spasticity that is not spinal in origin. Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls and women. Manifested in the advanced stages of this syndrome is increased spasticity leading to functional decline. Presented is a case report of a 32-yr-old white woman with Rett syndrome, diagnosed before the age of 2 yr, and significant spasticity that was successfully managed with intrathecal baclofen. After placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump, the dose was increased slowly during 1 yr to 800 microg/day with good clinical response. There was observed a significant decrease in upper and lower limb Ashworth scores, from an average of 3-4 to 2-3, during this 1-yr period. The decrease in spasticity in this patient eventually led to improved range of motion, positioning, skin care, hygiene, and quality of life.

12066906,Functional benefits and cost/benefit analysis of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion for the management of severe spasticity.,"Sampson FC, Hayward A, Evans G, Morton R, Collett B",J Neurosurg. 2002 Jun;96(6):1052-7.,"OBJECT: Intrathecally delivered baclofen has been used as a treatment for severe spasticity since 1984. Despite this, there are uncertainties surrounding the benefits of treatment and the costs involved. The authors assessed the evidence of benefits and identified costs and the cost/benefit ratio for continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in the treatment of severe spasticity. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to estimate the effect of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion on function and quality-of-life (QOL) measures in patients with severe spasticity. Outcomes were related to standard QOL scores to estimate potential gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Information on the costs of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion was obtained from hospitals in the United Kingdom. This information was combined to estimate the cost/benefit ratio for the use of continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion in patients with different levels of disability from severe spasticity. Studies indicate that bedbound patients are likely to improve their mobility and become able to sit out of bed. Patients with severe spasm-related pain are likely to have major improvement or complete resolution of this pain. Many other benefits are also reported. Such benefits are related to costs per QALY in the range of 6,900 pounds to 12,800 pounds ($10,550-$19,570 US). CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients who have not responded to less invasive treatments, continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion is likely to lead to worthwhile functional benefits. Continuous intrathecal baclofen infusion has an acceptable cost/benefit ratio compared with other interventions that are funded by the health service.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*economics/*therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics, Female, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Implantable/economics, Infusions, Parenteral/economics, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*economics/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*economics/physiopathology, Quality of Life, Recovery of Function/drug effects/physiology, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

Tinnitus, like pain, is a subjective symptom. The problem is compounded because several different mechanisms must operate to cause the persistent sensation of tinnitus. Therefore, it is difficult to measure objectively any improvements in the condition. For example, it has been reported previously that sectioning the eighth cranial nerve does not abolish tinnitus in a majority of patients; therefore, central mechanisms must act to preserve the tinnitus. Finally, we know that tinnitus can occur in a host of conditions other than ototoxicity, aging, and noise exposure. Other conditions that may produce tinnitus are migraine headache with auditory aura, temporal lobe seizures, and head injuries. Therefore, it is naive to conceptualize that tinnitus is a disorder with a unitary origin and a unitary ""cure"".","Diagnosis, Differential, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Humans, Prognosis, Tinnitus/chemically induced/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy",-1
10335049,Should people with nocturnal leg cramps drink tonic water and bitter lemon?,Brasic JR,Psychol Rep. 1999 Apr;84(2):355-67.,"A literature search from 1993 to 1997 using MEDLINE and key-words beverages, muscle cramp, and quinine was performed. Three beverages containing quinine were examined in grocery stores. Analysis indicate that leg cramps are a common phenomenon associated with many comorbid disorders especially peripheral vascular and neurologic disorders. Thus, evaluation of a patient's complaining of leg cramps appropriately includes vascular, neurologic, and musculoskeletal examinations. Laboratory investigation of the symptom of leg cramps warrants as a minimum, assessment of thyroid function and determination of platelet counts and serum levels of electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium. A few small studies suggest that quinine is effective in decreasing the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps but not their severity or duration. Quinine consumed in commercial beverages has been reported to cause potentially fatal immunologically mediated hypersensitivity reactions. The concentration of quinine in commercial beverages varies greatly. Although commercial beverages containing quinine generally are labeled ""Contains quinine,"" they typically lack both nutritional information about the amount of quinine and warnings of the health risks. It appears that 325 milligrams of quinine taken by mouth at bedtime typically relieves nocturnal leg cramps, but lower starting doses are appropriate for senior citizens and individuals with impaired renal function. In general, quinine in any form should be avoided by pregnant women and people with hepatic failure. Quinine consumed for the treatment of leg cramps should be prescribed and monitored by physicians, and people who consume quinine in commercial beverages must be warned of the health risks.","*Carbonated Beverages, *Circadian Rhythm, *Citrus, *Drinking Behavior, Female, Humans, *Leg, Male, Muscle Cramp/classification/*therapy, Muscle Relaxants, Central/adverse effects/contraindications/therapeutic use, Pregnancy, Quinine/adverse effects/contraindications/therapeutic use, Spasm/*therapy",-1

The present study is a retrospective analysis of the effect of drug withdrawal therapy in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication. One hundred and one adult patients (74 women and 27 men, aged between 16 and 72 years, mean age 43 years) were evaluated 1-3 months after drug withdrawal therapy had been initiated. The mean headache frequency at baseline was 26.9+/-4.0 days per month. Fifty-seven (56%) patients were significantly improved (defined as at least 50% reduction in number of headache days) after a period of drug withdrawal therapy. Based on the outcome of the drug withdrawal therapy, the patients were divided into three categories: group I, those who had between 0 and 10 headache days per month (n = 41), group II, those who had 11-20 days (n = 37), and group III, those who had 21-30 days (n = 23). The mean headache frequencies in groups I, II and III were 5.6+/-2.8 days, 15.7+/-2.5 days and 28.7+/-2.4 days, respectively. Treatment with amitriptyline was offered to patients in whom no improvement had been achieved. Ten of those 22 patients (36%) experienced a significant (> or = 50%) reduction of headache days. It is concluded that out-patient drug withdrawal therapy is the treatment of choice in patients with CDH and frequent long-term use of headache symptomatic medication, and that about one quarter of these CDH patients do not respond to drug withdrawal therapy only.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Amitriptyline/therapeutic use, Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Female, Headache/*chemically induced/*drug therapy, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Retreatment, Retrospective Studies, Substance-Related Disorders/*complications/*therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

12383029,Therapeutic potential of kava in the treatment of anxiety disorders.,"Singh YN, Singh NN",CNS Drugs. 2002;16(11):731-43.,"Anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders that affect all age groups of the general population. Currently, the preferred treatment is with pharmacological drugs that have antidepressant or anti-anxiety properties. However, these agents have numerous and often serious adverse effects, including sedation, impaired cognition, ataxia, aggression, sexual dysfunction, tolerance and dependence. Withdrawal reactions on termination after long-term administration are also a major limiting factor in the use of these agents. Herbal remedies, including kava (Piper methysticum), have been shown to be effective as alternative treatments, at least in mild to moderate cases of anxiety. Kava is a social and ceremonial herb from the South Pacific. It is available in the west as an over-the-counter preparation. Its biological effects, due to a mixture of compounds called kavalactones, are reported to include sedative, anxiolytic, antistress, analgesic, local anaesthetic, anticonvulsant and neuroprotective properties. The pharmacological properties of kava are postulated to include blockade of voltage-gated sodium ion channels, enhanced ligand binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors, diminished excitatory neurotransmitter release due to calcium ion channel blockade, reduced neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline (norepinephrine), reversible inhibition of monoamine oxidase B and suppression of the synthesis of the eicosanoid thromboxane A(2), which antagonises GABA(A) receptor function. Clinical studies have shown that kava and kavalactones are effective in the treatment of anxiety at subclinical and clinical levels, anxiety associated with menopause and anxiety due to various medical conditions. Until recently, the adverse effects attributed to kava use were considered mild or negligible, except for the occurrence of a skin lesion. This disorder, called kava dermopathy, occurs only with prolonged use of large amounts of kava and is reversible on reduced intake or cessation. Rare cases of interactions have occurred with pharmaceutical drugs that share one or more mechanisms of action with the kavalactones. In the past few years, about 35 cases of severe liver toxicity associated with kava intake have been reported in Europe and the US. However, a direct causal relationship with kava use has been difficult to establish in the majority of the cases, and there is insufficient evidence to implicate kava as the responsible agent. Nevertheless, until further research clarifies any causality, kava should be used with caution.","Animals, Anti-Anxiety Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/*drug therapy/psychology, Brain/drug effects/metabolism, Clinical Trials as Topic, Cognition/drug effects, Drug Interactions, Humans, Ion Channels/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism, *Kava, Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Neurotransmitter Agents/metabolism, *Phytotherapy, Plant Extracts/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Psychomotor Performance/drug effects, Thromboxane A2/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis, Treatment Outcome",-1

BACKGROUND: Chronic daily headache is among the most common diagnoses seen in specialized headache centers. Prior to 1988, there were no criteria for the diagnosis of chronic tension-type headache and chronic daily headache. An expanded chronic daily headache classification has been proposed. METHODS: A MEDLINE search was performed using the following key words: chronic daily headache, intractable headache, transformed migraine, chronic tension headache, and chronic tension-type headache. We limited our review to those studies published in English in the last decade, including published abstracts and letters to the editor. Double-blind studies carried out prior to 1988 were also included. RESULTS: Pharmacological treatments for chronic daily headache include antidepressants (tricyclics, tetracyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, 5-HT1 agonists, ergots, 5-HT2 antagonists, antianxiety agents, and miscellaneous drugs. Many of these reports are anecdotal, and most are open rather than double-blind studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a great variety of pharmacological treatments available for chronic daily headache. Only the antidepressants have been extensively studied. Other medications may be used if these fail. Recommendations based on our experience at the Headache Unit of the Montefiore Medical Center are outlined here.","Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/contraindications/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Headache/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control, Headache Disorders/classification/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control, Humans, Periodicity",1

The cost-of-illness method, based on the human capital theory, was used as the theoretical framework. The study used a cross-sectional approach, in which resource utilization data and quality-of-life data (utilities) were collected at a single time point. The total cost of MS was estimated at 4868 MSEK, or 586 MEUR, giving an annual cost of 442 500 SEK, or 53 250 EUR, per patient (1USD = 9.73 SEK, 1 EUR = 8.31 SEK, as of 21 September 2000). Direct costs accounted for about 67% of total cost, and they were dominated by the cost of personal assistants and drugs. Indirect costs (loss of production) accounted for about 33% of total costs. To these economic costs, intangible costs of 2702 MSEK (325 MEUR) should be added as well. Direct, indirect and informal care costs all rose significantly with increased disability and were higher during a relapse. Quality of life declined substantially with increased disability and was lower during a relapse. Multiple sclerosis was found to be associated with much higher costs to society than has been ascertained by former studies. The study also revealed a strong correlation between severity of the disease and quality of life.

12623501,A mysterious temporal penetrating head wound without fracture.,"Burke DT, Schneider JC, Ahangar B, Al-Adawi S",Brain Inj. 2003 Mar;17(3):245-53.,"Unwitnessed head injuries are often diagnostic and management dilemmas. Low-velocity penetrating head wounds are rare. This paper describes a case of an accidental low-velocity penetrating head wound through the soft tissue of the temporal region. This lesion resulted in a deep intra-cerebral haemorrhage, after the initial assessment revealed no evidence of skull fracture, missile or missile track. The diagnostic evaluation and medical course of this case are presented. This is the first case in the medical literature of a brain injury by an object that penetrated the calvarium at low velocity but which did not produce a fracture of the skull. The evolving diagnostic dilemma is outlined to its conclusion, through 3 years of follow-up observation.","Adult, Brain Injuries/diagnosis/etiology, Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/etiology, Cognition Disorders/etiology/psychology, Craniocerebral Trauma/diagnosis/*etiology/rehabilitation, Humans, Male, Psychological Tests, Rehabilitation, Vocational, Tomography, X-Ray Computed/methods, Wounds, Penetrating/diagnosis/*etiology/rehabilitation",-1

OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of cyclobenzaprine's effectiveness in the treatment of back pain. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PsycLIT, CINAHL, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, HEALTHSTAR, CANCERLIT, the Cochrane Library, Micromedex, Federal Research in Progress, and the references of reviewed articles, and contacted Merck, Sharpe and Dohme for English-language, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cyclobenzaprine in adults with back pain. Outcomes included global improvement and 5 specific domains of back pain (local pain, muscle spasm, range of motion, tenderness to palpation, and activities of daily living). Study quality was assessed using the methods of Jadad. Summary outcomes were obtained using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Patients treated with cyclobenzaprine were nearly 5 times (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.7-8.1) as likely to report symptom improvement by day 14 as were those treated with placebo. Slightly fewer than 3 individuals (2.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-4.2) needed treatment for 1 to improve. The magnitude of this improvement was modest, with an effect size of 0.38 to 0.58 in all 5 outcomes (local pain, muscle spasm, tenderness to palpation, range of motion, and activities of daily living). Treatment efficacy for these 5 outcomes was greatest early, in the first few days of treatment, declining after the first week. Patients receiving cyclobenzaprine also experienced more adverse effects, the most common being drowsiness. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclobenzaprine is more effective than placebo in the management of back pain; the effect is modest and comes at the price of greater adverse effects. The effect is greatest in the first 4 days of treatment, suggesting that shorter courses may be better. Studies comparing the relative value of acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cyclobenzaprine individually and in combination in the treatment of back pain are needed.","Amitriptyline/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Back Pain/*drug therapy, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",1

Almost half of the patients with spastic tetraplegia and hemiplegia had epilepsy. The incidence was lower in patients with spastic diplegia. No sex differences were observed. Partial seizures were by far the most common form of epilepsy in spastic hemiplegia, while generalized tonic-clonic episodes predominated in all other forms of CP. A very high incidence of West syndrome was observed in patients with spastic tetraplegia. Most of the patients with spastic tetraplegia had their first seizure in the first year of life. In patients with spastic hemiplegia the onset of epilepsy was often delayed for several years. A high rate of polytherapy was recorded, but two-thirds of the patients remained seizure-free for long periods.

To assess the current usage of diazepam in those persons with SCI being followed by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (DVAMCs), a survey was mailed to all 23 DVAMCs that have specialized SCI Services. We discovered that no policy regarding the prescription of benzodiazepines existed at 65 percent of the SCI Services. At 70 percent of the SCI Services, diazepam or another benzodiazepine was routinely prescribed. One-third of patients were estimated to have taken diazepam for greater than 10 years and an additional 37 percent for six to 10 years. Despite the potential for addiction, only 10 of the 23 SCI Services reported having a program to encourage discontinuation of diazepam use; a 20 percent success rate was reported in withdrawing this medication. A need for greater understanding with regard to the prescription of diazepam exists and strategies for its withdrawal should be considered. Appropriate guidelines for its use in patients with SCI and spasticity should be developed.","Baclofen/therapeutic use, Data Collection, Diazepam/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Hospitals, Veterans, Humans, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology, Physician's Practice Patterns, Spinal Cord Injuries/*complications, *Veterans",-1

METHODS: Six children with clinical signs of upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from an acquired cerebral hypoxic injury were tested. Simultaneous multichannel acquisition of surface EMG activity from flexor/extensor muscle groups of the upper and lower limbs was recorded. Investigated muscle group pairs included biceps/triceps brachii, wrist flexors/extensors, rectus/biceps femoris and tibialis anterioris/gastrocnemius. Time-frequency analysis of EMG activity at rest and while eliciting a stretch reflex was performed. The non-linear cross-correlation coefficient and time lag estimation were computed between paired channel groups both for baseline and post-intrathecal baclofen injection conditions for epochs consisting of 2 s prior to and 2 s after voluntary contraction. The effect of baclofen was assessed 3 h following single-bolus intrathecal injections of 25 or 50 microg during the baclofen trial and 6 months after baclofen pump implantation. RESULTS: In the baseline condition, the stretch reflex resulted in a synchronous increase in spectral EMG power in both the agonist and the antagonist muscles. The mean correlation coefficient between agonist and antagonist muscles was 0.948 (SD = 0.034), and the mean time lag was 4.64 ms (SD = 1.84 ms). After intrathecal administration of baclofen, a dramatic decrease in the correlation coefficient between agonist and antagonists (mean value = 0.342) during voluntary contraction was observed. This corresponded to a significant reduction of tone and spasticity in all four limbs, and reduction of the Ashworth score by 2 points on average. CONCLUSION: After intrathecal baclofen administration, we observed a significant decrease in the co-contraction pattern typically associated with upper motor neuron spasticity. This was evident clinically and was quantitatively expressed by the significantly decreased degree of coupling in EMG activity of agonist/antagonist muscles. Although a relatively small sample was investigated in this study, we were able to demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure in restoring selective activation of agonists during voluntary contraction. This is one of the prerequisites of an improvement of motor function in patients with spasticity.","Adolescent, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/*complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Child, Electromyography, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Motor Neuron Disease/*complications/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Muscle Contraction/*drug effects/physiology, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/physiopathology, Time Factors",-1

The primary aim of this study was to measure the safety and tolerability of LEV individualised dosing in a heterogeneous refractory epilepsy population. METHODS: LEV was evaluated in a 10- to 16-week open-label, multicentre study in adult patients with epilepsy refractory to previous treatment with at least two AEDs. Individualised LEV doses up to 3000 mg x day(-1) were determined in an initial up-titration phase, and optimal doses were administered as adjunctive treatment during an 8- to 10-week evaluation period. Concomitant AEDs and their doses could not be changed during the study. Safety and tolerability were monitored by expression of adverse events as well as by retention rate. The effect of LEV on concomitant AED concentration was also studied. Efficacy was assessed using global clinical evaluation (GCE) scores, seizure frequency, and >or=50% responder rate. RESULTS: LEV therapy was initiated in 219 patients; 183 had localisation-related epilepsy and 37 had generalised epilepsy. In one patient, epileptic syndrome was defined as both localisation-related and generalised. About 81.7% (179/219) continued and completed treatment throughout the study, and 79% (172/219) chose to continue LEV in a follow-up study. The most common adverse events were asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence. Most adverse events occurred during up-titration. LEV treatment did not alter the concentration of concomitant AEDs. LEV improved GCE scores in 79.5% (152/191) of patients. LEV reduced the median total seizure frequency of all patients from a median of 2.25 seizures per week at baseline (n=219) to 1.10 seizures per week during the evaluation period (n=191 patients with at least one seizure count during evaluation). The >or=50% responder rate was 48.2% for all seizure types, 49.4% for partial-onset, and 51.4% for generalised-onset seizures. Throughout the evaluation period (i.e. from the start of the evaluation period until completion or early discontinuation), 26/191 (13.6%) had a 100% reduction in total seizure frequency, while in a follow-up study, 10.5% (18/172) were seizure-free for at least 6 months and 6.4% (11/172) were seizure-free for at least 1 year. CONCLUSION: LEV was well tolerated, as evidenced by limited adverse event reporting and the high retention rate, and appeared effective in both generalised and partial epilepsy.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anticonvulsants/administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Administration Schedule, Drug Evaluation, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsy/blood/*drug therapy/epidemiology, Female, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neurologic Examination, Piracetam/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs &, derivatives/blood/*therapeutic use, Single-Blind Method, Treatment Outcome",-1

The prevalence of epilepsy in NES patients is higher than in the general population, so epilepsy can be understood as a risk factor for NES. The question emerges if psychopathology differs in NES patients with and without epilepsy. Retrospective data concerning psychopathology and personality in both groups show two differences: (1) somatoform disorders are more prevalent in NES-only patients and (2) personality disorders are more typical in NES patients with epilepsy and resemble the pattern of psychopathology found in epilepsy-only patients. If true, then NES in epilepsy patients may be associated with an epilepsy condition. Consequently, in studies of psychopathology in epilepsy patients, patients with comorbid nonepileptic seizures have to be included.","Adult, Comorbidity, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Epilepsy/*epidemiology/*psychology, Female, Humans, Male, Personality Disorders/diagnosis/etiology, Prevalence, Retrospective Studies, Seizures/epidemiology/psychology, Severity of Illness Index, Somatoform Disorders/diagnosis/etiology",-1

This review examines the evidence on which general practitioners can base clinical diagnosis and management of this relatively common complaint. Research in this area has in the main been from secondary and tertiary centres and has been of variable quality. Indications are that the conditions that present in general practice are most likely to be benign positional vertigo, acute vestibular neuronitis, and Meniere's disease; however, vascular incidents and neurological causes, such as multiple sclerosis, must be kept in mind. An important practice point is that vestibular sedatives are not recommended on a prolonged basis for any type of vertigo.

The mean age of the patients was 39.1 years. The prevailing pathology was multiple sclerosis. All were unable to walk. Patient assessment was based on the Ashworth Scale, the Spasms Frequency Scale, self-reported pain and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores. The Wilcoxon test was used for statistical analysis. A statistically significant decrease in muscle tone, spasms and pain was observed in all the patients. The Ashworth score decreased from 4.4 to 1.8, the spasms frequency score from 2.5 to 0.5 and the self-reported pain score from 5.5 to 2.3. The FIM score also showed a statistically significant change (increasing from a mean of 33.8 to 58.7). Two patients in employment were able to return to work. No severe side effects were observed.

7551119,The treatment of multiple sclerosis: current and future.,"Polman CH, Hartung HP",Curr Opin Neurol. 1995 Jun;8(3):200-9.,"During the past year observations have been published that might lead to further improvement in the design of future clinical trials. At the same time, results of clinical trials have become available that suggest that a number of treatments could be of benefit in the care of patients in the various phases of multiple sclerosis. Future multiple sclerosis clinical trials should involve a blinded investigator restricted to assessing the clinical outcome variables, and because current evidence suggests that magnetic resonance imaging gives an objective and sensitive reflection of the biological evolution of the disease, such scanning should also be included. The use of a composite outcome variable in a trial of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis should also be considered in order to increase the percentage of patients reaching the clinical endpoint. In 1994 recommendations were published for the selection of relapsing-remitting patients for treatment with interferon beta-1b; furthermore, large and well performed clinical trials demonstrated that interferon beta-1a and copolymer-1 are also partially effective, though not curative, for these patients. Two smaller studies suggested that low-dose methotrexate and cladribine might have a beneficial effect on the course of the disease in patients with secondary chronic progressive multiple sclerosis, the former drug probably being less toxic. Unfortunately, therapeutic perspectives for patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis are less promising at present. Several studies suggest that 4-aminopyridine and tizanidine have therapeutic potential for symptomatic treatment; the former by improving neurological deficits, the latter by relieving troublesome spasticity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Adjuvants, Immunologic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use, Antiviral Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Brain/drug effects/pathology, Double-Blind Method, Forecasting, Humans, Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Interferon-beta/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Multiple Sclerosis/diagnosis/immunology/*therapy, Peptides/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",-1

The RM test measures passive range of motion (ROM) by electrogoniometry and stretch reflex activity (SRA) of the flexors and extensors of the knee and ankle by surface electromyography. The SRA has a dynamic component (dynamic stretch reflex, DSR) and a tonic component (tonic stretch reflex, TSR). Four hypotheses were formulated: (a) RM results show a negative relationship between SRA and ROM; (b) values on the RM test are correlated with clinical scores of tonus and spasticity; (c) RM results show a reduction in SRA after administration of the clinically optimal dose of baclofen; and (d) RM results show a dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on SRA. Twenty-four patients were selected because they had impairments and disabilities caused by intractable spasticity. A bolus of baclofen was administered with incremental doses (25-150 micrograms) until an optimal effect or no effect was obtained. The main outcome measures were RM test and clinical assessments of the Ashworth and spasm score. The results were (a) For the ankle a negative correlation was found between ROM and TSR of the flexor and extensors; for the knee a significant negative correlation was found only with the DSR of the biceps femoris. (b) A positive correlation was found between the Ashworth score and TSR of the extensors and between the spasm score and DSR and TSR of the gastrocnemius muscle. (c) Significant differences were found between baseline measurements and the optimal dose of baclofen for all measures. (d) A significant dose-dependent effect of intrathecal baclofen on the level of SRA was observed. The RM test is thus a useful clinical tool for objectively measuring the effect of intrathecal baclofen administration on spasticity in patients with an upper motor neuron syndrome.","Adolescent, Adult, Ankle Joint/physiopathology, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Electromyography, Female, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Knee Joint/physiopathology, Leg, Male, Middle Aged, Movement/*drug effects, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/physiopathology, Range of Motion, Articular, Reflex, Stretch",-1

The effects of the same drugs are compared in various preparations: complete spinal, partial spinal or intact cats. This has revealed that there can be major differences in these effects. In turn, this suggests that although the locomotor rhythm might normally be triggered and modulated by the activation of a variety of receptors (noradrenaline, serotonin, glutamate), after spinalization there appears to be a predominance of glutamatergic mechanisms. Recent work also suggests that, in the cat, the integrity of the midlumbar segments is crucial for the expression of spinal locomotion. Taken together, this work raises some hope that a targeted pharmacotherapy with better understood drugs and mode and locus of delivery could become a clinical reality.","2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate/pharmacology, Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacology, Animals, Cats, Clonidine/*pharmacology, Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology, Locomotion/*physiology, Recovery of Function/*drug effects, Spinal Cord Injuries/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Sympatholytics/*pharmacology, Yohimbine/pharmacology",-1
7594165,Excitatory amino acids in health and disease.,Thomas RJ,J Am Geriatr Soc. 1995 Nov;43(11):1279-89.,"PURPOSE: To review the role of excitatory neurotransmitters in normal mammalian brain function, the concept of excitotoxic neuronal death as an important final common path in a variety of diseases, and modification of excitatory synaptic transmission as an important new pharmacological principle. These principles are discussed, with special emphasis on diseases of importance to older adults. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search from 1966 to May 1995 was undertaken, as well as a manual search of current issues of clinical and basic neuroscience journals, for articles that addressed glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate and/or excitotoxicity. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 5398 original and 68 review articles were identified that addressed animal and human experimentation relevant to excitotoxic neuronal death. There were 364 articles with potential significance for clinical application identified; 132 of the most recent references are provided. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were classified into three categories: general receptor, biology pathogenesis of disease, and pharmacotherapy. RESULTS: Glutamic and aspartic acids are the physiological mediators of most excitatory synaptic transmission. This is critical to several normal nervous system functions, including memory and long-term modification of synaptic transmission and nociception. Activation of the inotropic NMDA and non-NMDA receptors increases transmembrane calcium and sodium fluxes, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor activation results in generation of inositol triphosphate and inhibition of adenylate cyclase. Numerous modulatory sites exist, especially on the NMDA receptor. Nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, superoxide, and intracellular calcium overload are the ultimate mediators of neuronal death. Glutamate re-uptake transporters belong to a unique family of amino acid transport systems, the malfunction of which is intricately involved in disease pathogenesis. Ischemic stroke, hypoglycemia, Parkinson's disease, alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and chronic pain syndromes are only some of the important clinical neurological disorders with a major pathogenic role for the excitatory amino acids. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory amino acid receptors is likely to be of benefit in important and common diseases of the nervous system. Only a few of the currently available drugs that modify excitatory neurotransmission, such as remacemide, lamotrigine, and tizanidine, have an acceptable therapeutic index. The identification of numerous receptor subtypes, topographic variabilities of distribution, and multiple modulatory sites will provide a true challenge to the neuropharmacologist.","Aged, Aging/metabolism, Animals, Excitatory Amino Acids/classification/metabolism/*physiology, Humans, Nervous System Diseases/metabolism, Receptors, Glutamate/*physiology, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/physiology",-1

RESULTS: Pantoprazole selectively accumulates in the acidic environment of gastric parietal cells and acts at the final step of acid secretion by binding 2 key cysteine residues of the proton pump involved in gastric acid production. The bioavailability of pantoprazole is not altered by concomitant administration of food or antacids or with repeated dosing. Both oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. Several clinical trials have proved pantoprazole superior to histamine-2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in reducing acid secretion and elevating gastric pH levels. Pantoprazole has been shown to be more effective than ranitidine (P < 0.05), famotidine (P < 0.001), and nizatidine (P < 0.05), and at least as effective as omeprazole, in healing erosive esophagitis and relieving associated symptoms of GERD, including regurgitation. Pantoprazole is also more effective than the H2RA nizatidine for the treatment of nighttime heartburn (P < 0.05). Studies have shown pantoprazole to be well tolerated; adverse events, including headache, diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal pain, eructation, nausea, and rash, occurred in < or = 6% of patients. The oral and IV formulations of pantoprazole are equally potent in inhibiting gastric acid secretion; thus, switching between formulations requires no dosage adjustments. Special patient populations, including the elderly and patients with renal or mild to moderate hepatic impairment, can take pantoprazole without an adjustment in dosage. CONCLUSIONS: Because of its unique pharmacokinetic properties, mechanism of action, and reduced potential for producing cytochrome P-450-based drug interactions, pantoprazole in both oral and IV formulations is effective over a full 24 hours and is well tolerated in a variety of patient types.","2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles, Administration, Oral, Adult, Aged, *Anti-Ulcer Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, *Benzimidazoles/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use, Biological Availability, Clinical Trials as Topic, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/drug effects, Drug Interactions, Gastroesophageal Reflux/*drug therapy, Humans, Injections, Intravenous, Omeprazole/analogs & derivatives, Proton Pump Inhibitors, *Sulfoxides/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use",-1
12631450,Medical therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain.,"Singh VV, Toskes PP",Curr Gastroenterol Rep. 2003 Apr;5(2):110-6.,"Chronic pancreatitis should be considered in all patients with unexplained abdominal pain. Management of abdominal pain in these patients continues to pose a formidable challenge. The importance of small duct disease without radiographic abnormalities is now a well-established concept. It is meaningful to determine whether patients with chronic pancreatitis have small duct or large duct disease because this distinction has therapeutic implications. Diagnostic evaluation should begin with simple noninvasive and inexpensive tests like serum trypsinogen and fecal elastase, to be followed where appropriate by more complicated measures such as the secretin hormone stimulation test, especially in patients with suspected small duct disease. No universal causal treatment is available. Non-enteric-coated enzyme preparations are useful for treatment of pain, whereas enteric-coated enzyme preparations are preferred for steatorrhea. Octreotide is used increasingly for abdominal pain that is unresponsive to pancreatic enzyme therapy. When medical therapy for chronic pancreatitis pain has failed, endoscopic therapy, endoscopic ultrasound-guided celiac plexus block, and thoracoscopic splanchnicectomy, performed by experts, may be considered for a highly selected patient population. Surgical ductal decompression is appropriate in patients with considerable pancreatic ductal dilation. The role and efficacy of cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists, antioxidants, and antidepressant drugs remain to be defined.","Abdominal Pain/etiology, Cholecystokinin/antagonists & inhibitors, Chronic Disease, Devazepide/therapeutic use, Endosonography, Gastrointestinal Agents/therapeutic use, Gastroparesis, Hormone Antagonists/therapeutic use, Humans, Octreotide/therapeutic use, Pancreatic Function Tests, Pancreatitis/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy/physiopathology",-1

The diagnosis is made through clinical observations made by the examiner. Differential diagnosis must include other somatic syndromes as well as disease entities like hepatitis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, electrolyte imbalance, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. Diagnostic criteria are given as guidelines for the diagnosis, not as absolute requirements. Treatment of this condition remains individualized and relies heavily on having a therapeutic relationship with a provider. Treatment of this syndrome needs to be looked at as an ongoing process. Goal oriented treatment aimed at maintaining specific functions can be directed at helping a patient get restorative sleep, alleviating the somatic pains that ail the patient, keeping a person productive, regulating schedules or through goal oriented agreements made with the patient. Since this syndrome is chronic and may effect all areas of a persons functioning the family and social support system of the person being treated need to be evaluated. Patients often seek alternative medical treatments for this problem including diet therapy, acupuncture, and herbal therapy. Treatment must involve more than just the symptoms presented and the patient can only be treated successfully if they are willing to work at changing their own perceptions, and ways of relating to stressors in their world.","Adaptation, Psychological, Adult, Complementary Therapies/methods, Diagnosis, Differential, Female, Fibromyalgia/*diagnosis/genetics/psychology/therapy, Humans, Medical History Taking, Middle Aged, Myofascial Pain Syndromes, Personality, Physical Examination",-1

Thirty-nine subjects (35 women,. 4 men) with daily or near-daily orofacial pain of at least 3 months' duration and tenderness to palpation of masticatory muscles participated. Patients were randomly allocated to one of four treatments: placebo, diazepam, ibuprofen, or the combination of diazepam and ibuprofen. Pain, mood, muscle tenderness, maximal interincisal opening, and plasma levels of beta-endorphin were measured following 2-week baseline and 4-week treatment periods. Pain, as measured by a visual analog scale, was significantly decreased in the diazepam and diazepam plus ibuprofen groups but not for the ibuprofen or placebo groups. Analysis of variance showed a significant drug effect for diazepam but not for ibuprofen, indicating that pain relief was attributable to diazepam. No significant changes were noted in muscle tenderness, interincisal opening, or plasma beta-endorphin level. This study supports the efficacy of diazepam in the short-term management of chronic orofacial muscle pain. The lack of effect following administration of an anti-inflammatory analgesic suggests that inflammation is not the basis for chronic muscle pain in the orofacial region, and that the analgesic effect of such medications is not sufficient for pain relief in this condition.","Adult, Analysis of Variance, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Diazepam/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Therapy, Combination, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Facial Pain/*drug therapy, Female, Humans, Ibuprofen/*therapeutic use, Male, Pain Measurement, Statistics, Nonparametric, Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome/*drug therapy, beta-Endorphin/blood",-1

The study used a novel design that was symptom- rather than syndrome-based; an approach that aimed to reflect the realities of clinical practice. Participants had a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes, with at least two of the following symptoms: allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, or hyperalgesia. Patients were randomised to gabapentin (n=153) or placebo (n=152). Gabapentin was given in three divided doses, initially titrated to 900 mg/day over 3 days, followed by two further increases, to a maximum of 2400 mg/day if required by the end of week 5. The primary outcome measure was changed in average daily pain diary score (baseline versus final week). Over the 8 week study, this score decreased (i.e. improved) by 1.5 (21%) in gabapentin treated patients and by 1.0 (14%) in placebo treated patients (P=0.048, rank-based analysis of covariance). Significant differences were shown in favour of gabapentin (P<0.05) for the Clinician and Patient Global Impression of Change, and some domains of the Short Form-McGill Pain Questionnaire. Improvements were also shown in patient-reported outcomes in quality of life, as seen by significant differences in favour of gabapentin in several domains of the Short-Form-36 Health Survey. Gabapentin was well tolerated and the majority of patients completed the study (79 versus 73% for placebo). The most common adverse events were mild to moderate dizziness and somnolence, most of which were transient and occurred during the titration phase. This study shows that gabapentin reduces pain and improves some quality-of-life measures in patients with a wide range of neuropathic pain syndromes.","Acetates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, *Amines, Analysis of Variance, Chi-Square Distribution, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/*drug therapy/physiopathology/psychology, Quality of Life/psychology, Syndrome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

PATIENTS AND SETTING: This trial was offered in a tertiary referral center to three outpatients with severe pain who had exhausted other medical options, yet did not wish to undergo surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Felbamate was prescribed as the sole analgesic for approximately 1 month. OUTCOME MEASURES: A visual analogue scale was utilized. RESULTS: Felbamate potently diminished the severe pain of trigeminal neuralgia and was well tolerated. The drug was withdrawn because of subsequent reports elsewhere of aplastic anemia and hepatic failure associated with it when used for epilepsy. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggested that felbamate was effective in relieving trigeminal neuralgia. Stabilization of neuronal membrane depolarization was the most likely mechanism of action. However, significant potential risks preclude further use of felbamate in the management of nonmalignant pain. Principles that have proven useful in screening for new anticonvulsant drugs might be relevant to the development of methods by which to search for new analgesic drugs.","Aged, Analgesics/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Maxillary Diseases/drug therapy, Middle Aged, Neuralgia/*drug therapy, Pain Measurement, Phenylcarbamates, Propylene Glycols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Trigeminal Nerve",-1

These agents include venlafaxine, reboxetine, nefazodone and mirtazapine. Claims have been made for these agents in terms of improved efficacy, faster speed of onset of effect and greater safety in the treatment of depression compared with previous medications, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This article reviews the evidence for these improvements. Thirty active comparator studies were reviewed involving the third-generation antidepressant agents. While there were isolated reports of improvements over comparator agents for venlafaxine, reboxetine and mirtazepine, there were no convincing differences between third-generation agents and comparators in terms of overall efficacy, relapse prevention and speed of onset. The third-generation antidepressants were, however, of equivalent safety to SSRIs and maintained improvements in safety over first-generation agents.","Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, Depressive Disorder/*drug therapy/prevention & control, Humans, Recurrence/prevention & control, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",-1

Indicators to measure prescribing quality, including appropriateness of prescribing certain drugs or combinations of drugs, to hospital inpatients have been developed previously. OBJECTIVE: to modify prescribing indicators, including appropriateness of prescribing algorithms developed in the hospital setting, for use in nursing homes. DESIGN: an audit of prescribing to patients resident in a random sample of nursing homes on a single day. Setting, subjects: 22 nursing homes in the former South Thames Region selected from lists of nursing homes with more than 35 residents. All residents aged 65 years or over were eligible. METHODS: prescribing indicators, including evidence-based indicators of appropriateness of prescribing benzodiazepines, steroids with beta(2) agonists, antithrombotics with digoxin and aspirin with nitrates were adapted: to reflect where prophylaxis was not justified in terms of quality of life; and for use with primary care clinical records. Indicators were used to evaluate drugs prescribed to each resident to determine whether prescribing was appropriate. RESULTS: 13 indicators were successfully modified and applied. The 934 residents included were prescribed a mean of 5.1 regular items. Only 496/934 (55%) drug sensitivity statements were completed. Although 24% residents received benzodiazepines, clinical data indicated that only 7% received benzodiazepines appropriately. Over three-quarters of residents with ischaemic heart disease received appropriate aspirin therapy, but fewer than half residents with atrial fibrillation received appropriate antithrombotic therapy. It was not possible to derive reference ranges of observed prescribing that included homes demonstrating appropriate prescribing whilst excluding those with inappropriate prescribing.

METHOD: Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group (EPI, n = 48) received combined general and epidural anaesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia for 48 hrs. The other group (GA, n = 51) received general anaesthesia followed by postoperative intravenous analgesia. Anaesthetic goals were to maintain haemodynamic stability (+/- 20% of preoperative values), and a stroke volume > 1 ml.kg-1. A Holter monitor was attached to each patient the day before surgery. Leads 11, V2, and V5 were monitored. Myocardial ischaemia was defined as ST segment depression > 1 mm measured at 80 millisec beyond the J point or an elevation of 2 mm 60 millisec beyond the J point which lasted > 60 sec. An event that lasted > 60 sec but returned to the baseline for > 60 sec and then recurred, was counted as two separate events. The Holter tapes were reviewed by a cardiologist blind to the patient's group. RESULTS: There were no demographic differences between the two groups. Myocardial ischaemia was common; it occurred in 55% of patients. In hospital, preoperative ischaemia was uncommon (GA = 3, EPI = 8). Intraoperative ischaemia was common (GA = 18, EPI = 25). Mesenteric traction produced the largest number of ischaemic (GA = 11, EPI = 11) events. Postoperative ischaemia was most common on the day of surgery. Termination of epidural analgesia produced a burst of ischaemia (60 events in 9 patients). CONCLUSION: Combined general and epidural anaesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia do not reduce the incidence of myocardial ischaemia or morbidity compared with general anaesthesia and postoperative intravenous analgesia.","Aged, *Analgesia, Epidural, *Anesthesia, Epidural, *Anesthesia, General, Aorta/surgery, Female, Heart Rate, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Myocardial Ischemia/*prevention & control, Pain, Postoperative/*prevention & control",-1

We report two patients with an extension-producing myoclonus presenting with tetraplegia caused by cervical trauma. Rhythmic extension jerks of the trunk and lower limbs appeared several weeks after their injury in a context of severe spasticity. The characteristics of these jerks were determined by polymyography of 12 muscles. They lasted between 306 and 1127 ms with a frequency of 0.3 to 0.5 Hz. By comparing latencies their origin was found to be in the lumbar cord from which there was a slow (2 m s-1) upward and downward spread. Oral treatment with baclofen and sodium valproate was partially successful in one patient, but ineffective in the other. Intrathecal 75 or 100 micrograms baclofen produced a striking, complete disappearance of myoclonus prompting the implantation and successful use of a baclofen pump in one patient. These two new cases suggest the existence of a lumbar generator in which myoclonic extension jerks originate, and demonstrate a new therapeutic alternative in intrathecal baclofen for patients resistant to oral medication.","Adult, Baclofen/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Electromyography, Humans, Injections, Spinal, Male, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, Myoclonus/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Quadriplegia/*complications/rehabilitation",-1
9741072,Psychotropic adjuvant analgesics for pain in cancer and AIDS.,Breitbart W,Psychooncology. 1998 Jul-Aug;7(4):333-45.,"The 'WHO Analgesic Ladder' is a well validated approach for the selection of appropriate analgesic therapy for cancer pain as well as pain in AIDS. The mainstay of analgesic intervention for cancer and AIDS pain of moderate to severe intensity continues to be the appropriate use of opioid analgesics. There is, however, a growing appreciation for the role of adjuvant analgesics, such as antidepressants and other psychotropic medications, at each step of the WHO Analgesic Ladder, particularly in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Knowledge of the indications and usefulness of psychotropic analgesic drugs in cancer and AIDS pain populations will be most important to clinicians practicing in psycho-oncology/AIDS settings, particularly since these drugs are useful not only in the treatment of psychiatric complications of cancer and AIDS, but also as adjuvant analgesic agents in the management of pain. This paper reviews the literature on the use of antidepressants, psychostimulants, neuroleptics, anticonvulsants and other psychotropic analgesics in the management of cancer and AIDS pain. Mechanisms of analgesia, drug selection, and recommendations for clinical usage are discussed.

Unfortunately, the same mechanisms that protect it against intrusive chemicals can also frustrate therapeutic interventions. Many existing pharmaceuticals are rendered ineffective in the treatment of cerebral diseases due to our inability to effectively deliver and sustain them within the brain. General methods that can enhance drug delivery to the brain are, therefore, of great interest. Despite aggressive research, patients suffering from fatal and/or debilitating central nervous system (CNS) diseases, such as brain tumors, HIV encephalopathy, epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, far outnumber those dying of all types of systemic cancer or heart disease. The clinical failure of much potentially effective therapeutics is often not due to a lack of drug potency but rather to shortcomings in the method by which the drug is delivered. Treating CNS diseases is particularly challenging because a variety of formidable obstacles often impede drug delivery to the brain and spinal cord. By localizing drugs at their desired site of action one can reduce toxicity and increase treatment efficiency. In response to the insufficiency in conventional delivery mechanisms, aggressive research efforts have recently focused on the development of new strategies to more effectively deliver drug molecules to the CNS. This review intends to detail the recent advances in the field of brain-targeting, rational drug design approach and drug delivery to CNS. To illustrate the complexity of the problems that have to be overcome for successful brain targeting, a brief intercellular characterization of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is also included.","Biological Transport, Blood-Brain Barrier/physiology, Central Nervous System/*metabolism, *Drug Delivery Systems, Drug Design, Humans, Pharmaceutical Preparations/*administration & dosage/cerebrospinal fluid",-1

No attempt was made to analyze the efficacy of the two types of treatment. Nine children with spastic quadriplegia secondary to cerebral palsy in whom continuous intrathecal baclofen was attempted were matched as closely as possible with a group of 10 patients with spastic quadriplegia out of a total of 100 children who had undergone SFPR in the same time period. Clinical care flow charts were created to identify the various points of contact with members of the health care team, so that cost points could be identified and costs calculated. The cost per patient up to 1 year a after treatment CDN$ 64,163.10 for patients with implanted pumps for continuous intrathecal baclofen versus CDN$ 16,913.54 for SFPR. When adjustments were made to exclude costs and savings associated with research protocols, the average for the baclofen group decreased to approximately CDN$ 63,000, with minimal change for the SFPR group. The higher cost per patient on baclofen was related to the cost associated with screening patients who did not go on to have implantation of a continuous infusion pump, and to additional hospitalization for complications in the baclofen group. It is cautioned that this cost analysis was based on the experience at British Columbia's Children's Hospital, and the results may not be generalizable to other institutions or to other patient populations.","Adolescent, Baclofen/*administration & dosage/*economics/therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/*complications/*drug therapy/*surgery, Child, *Costs and Cost Analysis, Hospitalization, Humans, *Injections, Spinal, Length of Stay, Muscle Spasticity/*complications, Quadriplegia/*complications/*drug therapy/*surgery",-1

It requires a determination of the type of pain syndrome (i.e. nociceptive, neuropathic or mixed). Complete pain assessment also requires an understanding of other dimensions of suffering that a patient may be experiencing on psychological, social and spiritual/existential levels. The World Health Organization has introduced a three-step approach to treating pain. Opioids are the mainstay of therapy for moderate to severe pain at the end of life. Familiarity with the pharmacokinetics, equianalgesic dose and adverse effects of opioids is necessary for their safe and effective use. In addition, adjuvant analgesics such as antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants and local anaesthetics are often needed to optimise pain control, especially in patients with neuropathic pain. Given the complex aetiology of pain states, combinations of classes of adjuvants may sometimes be needed for effective treatment.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/therapeutic use, Analgesics/*pharmacology, Anesthetics, Local/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/therapeutic use, Drug Administration Routes, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Neoplasms/drug therapy, Pain/*drug therapy, Palliative Care/standards, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use, *Terminally Ill, Therapeutic Equivalency",-1

Although diazepam is commonly associated with a variety of side effects, it is generally not believed to cause fugue-like states or retrograde amnesia. This report presents the case of an active duty patient who developed a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia. This was associated with the short-term oral use of diazepam. There was no other apparent cause for his symptoms, which resolved within 24 hours after the diazepam was discontinued. This case suggests that short-term use of diazepam can lead to a brief fugue-like state with retrograde amnesia that has not been reported previously.","Administration, Oral, Adult, Amnesia/*chemically induced, Back Pain/drug therapy, Diazepam/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Dissociative Disorders/*chemically induced, Humans, Male, *Military Personnel, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, United States",-1
11824439,Oxcarbazepine: new preparation. An alternative to carbamazepine in partial epilepsy.,MISSING,Prescrire Int. 2001 Dec;10(56):170-4.,"(1) The reference treatment for partial epilepsy in adults and children is carbamazepine. (2) Oxcarbazepine is available in the European Union for the treatment of partial epilepsy in adults and children aged over 6 years, alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. (3) The clinical file on oxcarbazepine monotherapy of recent-onset generalised or partial epilepsy mainly contains data from one trial versus carbamazepine, two trials versus phenytoin, and one trial versus valproate sodium. In these trials, 52-60% of patients had no seizures on oxcarbazepine, a proportion not significantly different from that obtained with the comparators. Oxcarbazepine may, in fact, be slightly less effective than carbamazepine. (4) For refractory partial epilepsy (especially forms refractory to carbamazepine), oxcarbazepine is more effective than a placebo, when combined with the inadequately effective treatment, as shown in two trials. Two dose-finding studies show that 2 400 mg/day oxcarbazepine is more effective than 300 mg/day. (5) In trials comparing single-drug treatments there were fewer withdrawals for adverse events among patients on oxcarbazepine than among those on carbamazepine or phenytoin. Compared with carbamazepine, the risk of cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions seems to be lower with oxcarbazepine, while the risk of hyponatraemia is higher. This risk of hyponatraemia necessitates laboratory monitoring. (6) The risk of clinically significant interactions appears to be lower on oxcarbazepine than on carbamazepine, and is limited mainly to combined contraceptives (contraceptive inefficacy) and phenytoin. (7) In practice, carbamazepine remains the reference treatment for partial epilepsy, but oxcarbazepine is one of several second-line options, either alone or in combination with other antiepileptics.","Adult, Carbamazepine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use, Child, Clinical Trials as Topic, Drug Interactions, Drug Therapy, Combination, Epilepsies, Partial/classification/*drug therapy/epidemiology, European Union, Humans",-1
11721141,Spasticity: a rehabilitation challenge in the elderly.,Barnes MP,Gerontology. 2001 Nov-Dec;47(6):295-9.,"There is no doubt that spasticity is a significant cause of disability in the elderly. Regrettably, it is a condition that is often poorly treated and can result in a range of unnecessary complications which can cause further problems for the disabled person and their family. There are now a number of effective treatment options. However, before such options are defined the specific goals of rehabilitation need to be clarified and an appropriate outcome measure chosen in order to determine when such goals are being met. The treatment should be multidisciplinary and input from both the physician and a physiotherapist is essential. Involvement of the elderly person with spasticity, and often their family, is also important in the education process. Simple physiotherapy interventions can be remarkably helpful, including attention to positioning and seating. The role of the physician initially focuses on oral medication. Although we still have older drugs including diazepam, baclofen and dantrolene there are now more modern drugs including tizanidine and, more recently, gabapentin. However, most spasticity is focal in origin and thus requires focal treatment. Although phenol nerve blocks are sometimes helpful the use of botulinum toxin is now to be highly recommended. There is now clear evidence of the efficacy of botulinum toxin, which has been a significant advance in our management of spasticity. More advanced and difficult to treat problems can be alleviated by intrathecal baclofen or sometimes intrathecal phenol or, as a last resort, surgical intervention. The advent of lycra garments for the overall management of more diffuse spasticity is now becoming both fashionable and effective. CONCLUSION: The management of spasticity in the elderly person is a significant challenge to the rehabilitation team and a combined approach can produce significant benefit for the disabled elderly person.","Administration, Oral, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Botulinum Toxins/*administration & dosage, Female, Humans, Injections, Intralesional, Male, Muscle Spasticity/*diagnosis/*rehabilitation, Orthopedic Procedures/methods, Parasympatholytics/*administration & dosage, Physical Therapy Modalities, Prognosis, Severity of Illness Index, Treatment Outcome",-1

Group R was given 5-7 ml 0.2% ropivacaine and Group B 0.125% bupivacaine with both groups receiving 75 ng clonidine and 50 ng fentanyl with their first bolus of local anaesthetic. The parameters measured included the speed and spread of the sensory blockade and the scale of any motor blockade. The material haemodynamics and VAS pain relief scores were also measured at 30-minute intervals during labour and all side-effects (nausea, vomiting, localised or generalised itching, headache etc) were also monitored. Apgar anaesthetics and other drugs was decided on the basis of the VAS score (a further dose was given to women with a VAS of > 3-4). The study was completed by a telephone interview 6 months after delivery and the data were analysed using the Student's t-test and the chi 2 test. The analgesic effect was satisfactory in both groups and no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups under most of the headings analysed, apart from the top-up doses needed to maintain adequate analgesia. The average time between the first VAS to parturition was 292 mns in Group B and 267 mns in Groups R. Top-up doses of local anaesthetic (2.35 vs 5.05) came on average to 15.8 ml in Group B compared to 24.1 ml in Group R. There were 20% Caesarian sections in Group R and 13.8% in Group B. Optimum analgesia was achieved in Group R, the level of analgesia was insufficient or barely sufficient in 3.3% of cases. There was no Apgar score < 7 in either group. It was therefore concluded that both bupivacaine and ropivacaine offer excellent analgesia during labour and have no significant side effects on mothers or babies.","Adult, *Amides, *Analgesia, Obstetrical, *Anesthesia, Epidural, *Anesthetics, Local, Apgar Score, *Bupivacaine, Female, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Pregnancy",-1
10658982,Management of eclampsia in the accident and emergency department.,Munro PT,J Accid Emerg Med. 2000 Jan;17(1):7-11.,"Eclampsia is defined as the occurrence of seizures in pregnancy or within 10 days of delivery, accompanied by at least two of the following features documented within 24 hours of the seizure: hypertension, proteinuria, thrombocytopenia or raised aspartate amino transferase. Eclampsia complicates approximately one in 2,000 pregnancies in the United Kingdom and it remains one of the main causes of maternal death. Up to 38% of cases of eclampsia can occur without premonitory signs or symptoms of pre-eclampsia-that is, hypertension, proteinuria, and oedema. Only 38% of eclamptic seizures occur antepartum; 18% occur during labour and a further 44% occur postpartum. Rare cases of eclampsia have occurred over a week after delivery. Outcome is poor for mother and child. Almost one in 50 women suffering eclamptic seizures die, 23% will require ventilation and 35% will have at least one major complication including pulmonary oedema, renal failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, HELLP syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, or cardiac arrest. Stillbirth or neonatal death occurs in approximately one in 14 cases of eclampsia. Up to one third of eclamptic seizures occur out of hospital. For this reason, initial management may involve accident and emergency departments. Early involvement of senior obstetric staff is crucial. Optimal emergency management of seizures, hypertension, fluid balance and subsequent safe transfer is essential to minimise morbidity and mortality.","Diagnosis, Differential, Eclampsia/complications/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy, Emergency Treatment/*methods, Female, Great Britain/epidemiology, Humans, Maternal Mortality, Morbidity, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Pregnancy, Pregnancy Outcome/epidemiology, Prognosis, Severity of Illness Index",-1
11838624,Comparative efficacy of SSRIs and amisulpride in burning mouth syndrome: a single-blind study.,"Maina G, Vitalucci A, Gandolfo S, Bogetto F",J Clin Psychiatry. 2002 Jan;63(1):38-43.,"INTRODUCTION: Although a significant amount of evidence indicates the efficacy of some antidepressants in treating psychogenic pain and somatoform disorder, very few studies have investigated their possible therapeutic action in burning mouth syndrome (BMS). The purpose of this 8-week, single-blind study was to provide preliminary data on the efficacy and tolerability of amisulpride and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine and sertraline for patients with BMS. METHOD: Seventy-six patients with BMS (diagnosed according to the criteria in the literature and integrating the Diagnostic Interview Schedule-Revised for a complete psychiatric assessment), with no possible local or systemic causes and without concurrent major depression, were randomly assigned to receive amisulpride (50 mg/day), paroxetine (20 mg/day), or sertraline (50 mg/day). Efficacy assessments included a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain intensity, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). RESULTS: All 3 treatment regimens resulted in a significant improvement from baseline in burning mouth symptoms at week 8 as demonstrated by the quantitative (mean reduction in VAS, HAM-D, and HAM-A scores) and qualitative (percentage of responders) analyses. Amisulpride showed a shorter response latency than the SSRIs. No serious adverse events were reported, and the incidence of side effects did not differ among the 3 groups. None of the patients who received amisulpride withdrew from the trial, whereas withdrawal from the trial occurred within the first week of treatment in 11.5% of patients (N = 3) treated with paroxetine and in 21.7% of patients (N = 5) treated with sertraline. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that amisulpride and SSRIs may be effective treatments for BMS; they are equally effective and equally well tolerated in the short-term treatment of BMS. Amisulpride is associated with better compliance within the first week of treatment and with a shorter response latency in comparison with SSRIs. This finding may indicate that amisulpride is especially useful at the beginning of drug therapy of BMS. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to further document the efficacy of amisulpride and SSRIs in the treatment of BMS.","Antipsychotic Agents/*therapeutic use, Burning Mouth Syndrome/*drug therapy/psychology, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Paroxetine/therapeutic use, Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors/*therapeutic use, Sertraline/therapeutic use, Single-Blind Method, Sulpiride/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use, Treatment Outcome",-1

Interviews were completed with 50 self-identified medical cannabis users recruited through notices in newspapers and on bulletin boards. They reported using cannabis for a variety of conditions including HIV-AIDS-related problems, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, menstrual cramps, migraine, narcotic addiction as well as everyday aches, pains, stresses and sleeping difficulties. A majority also used cannabis for recreational purposes, and many were longer-term cannabis users. However, there were some notable exceptions. Almost all smoked cannabis and many did so two to three times a day. Few admitted negative experiences with cannabis, although some problems evident to the researchers were not clearly admitted. Those who told their doctors about their medical cannabis use found doctors noncommittal or supportive. The results raise questions about the definition of medical cannabis use and about policies that might be developed to accommodate such use. Limitations of the study are noted and further research suggested. Research priorities include population surveys, studies involving larger, more representative samples of medical cannabis users and studies of medical cannabis use among people with HIV-AIDS.","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy, Adult, *Cannabis, Chronic Disease, Data Collection/methods, *HIV, Humans, *Marijuana Smoking/psychology, Mental Disorders/*drug therapy, Middle Aged, Pain/*drug therapy, *Self Medication/methods/psychology",-1
9323748,The impact of OBRA-87 on psychotropic drug prescribing in skilled nursing facilities.,"Borson S, Doane K",Psychiatr Serv. 1997 Oct;48(10):1289-96.,"OBJECTIVES: This study examined the impact of regulations established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA-87) on prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, and on research on their use in nursing homes. METHODS: Data were collected on drugs prescribed for residents of 39 skilled nursing facilities over the four-year period from 1989 to 1992, bracketing the implementation of OBRA-87 in the fall of 1990. Changes in prescribing patterns were analyzed by drug class, specific target medications and doses, number of drugs prescribed, and multidrug combinations. To determine the effect of OBRA-87 on research, peer-reviewed journals were searched for the number and content of publications on psychotropic drug use in skilled nursing facilities between 1980 and 1996. RESULTS: The number of prescriptions for antipsychotics, sedative antihistamines, and sedative-hypnotics decreased significantly, while prescribing of anxiolytics increased. Qualitative, but not quantitative, shifts occurred in prescriptions for antidepressant drugs, the most frequently used psychotropic medications in all years. Rates of psychotropic polypharmacy remained stable. The number of data-based publications on psychotropic drug use in nursing homes increased after implementation of OBRA-87, but few were related to the effectiveness of drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of OBRA-87's nursing home regulations was associated with reductions in use of drugs specifically targeted by this legislation and was a potent stimulus to research, an unanticipated benefit of legislative action. Increased use of anxiolytics, persistent prescribing of anticholinergic antidepressants, enthusiastic adoption of new agents despite a limited research database involving frail patients, and the paucity of new studies reporting data on clinical effectiveness suggest a need for targeted research on treatment outcomes to improve the care of this population.","Aged, Alzheimer Disease/drug therapy, Drug Therapy, Combination, Drug Utilization/legislation & jurisprudence, Drug and Narcotic Control/*legislation & jurisprudence, Homes for the Aged/legislation & jurisprudence, Humans, Nursing Homes/legislation & jurisprudence, Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care), Psychotropic Drugs/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Skilled Nursing Facilities/*legislation & jurisprudence, Washington",-1

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the most frequently prescribed medications worldwide and are widely used for patients with low back pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of nonspecific low back pain with or without radiation, and to assess which type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is most effective. METHODS: For this study, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline and Embase, and reference lists of articles were searched. Two reviewers blinded with respect to authors, institution, and journal independently extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality of the studies. If data were considered clinically homogeneous, a meta-analysis was performed. If data were considered clinically heterogeneous, a qualitative analysis was performed using a rating system with four levels of evidence: strong, moderate, limited, and no evidence. RESULTS: This review involved 51 trials and 6057 patients. Of these trials, 16 (31%) were of high quality. The pooled relative risk for global improvement after 1 week was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.41), and for additional analgesic use was 1.29 (95% CI = 1.05-1.57), indicating a statistically significant but small effect in favor of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as compared with a placebo. The results of the qualitative analysis showed that there is conflicting evidence (Level 3) that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are more effective than paracetamol for acute low back pain, and that there is moderate evidence (Level 2) that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not more effective than other drugs for acute low back pain. There is strong evidence (Level 1) that various types of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are equally effective for acute low back pain. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from the 51 trials included in this review suggests that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a specific type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is clearly more effective than others. Sufficient evidence on chronic low back pain still is lacking.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use, Humans, Low Back Pain/*drug therapy, Middle Aged, Pain Measurement, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome",-1

Efficacy was evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Revised Symptom Checklist and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. A successful response to treatment was achieved in 91% (10/11) of patients who received trazodone and 57% (four of seven) of patients who were administered clorazepate (P = 0.1373). Bayesian analysis revealed that the prior probability of making a wrong decision in prescribing trazodone rather than clorazepate reduced from 26% to 8%. Assessment of the clinical scales suggested a benefit of trazodone compared with clorazepate, although the differences were not significant. Safety of both treatments was similar. Trazodone is devoid of an abuse risk and dependence and, therefore, could be a valuable alternative to clorazepate in the treatment of adjustment disorders in cancer patients.","Adjustment Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology, Adult, Aged, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*therapeutic use, Anxiety, Breast Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy, Clorazepate Dipotassium/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Depression, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Middle Aged, Pilot Projects, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Safety, Trazodone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use",-1

Evaluation for Rasmussen's encephalitis, focal cortical dysplasia, or a gliomatous process was conducted; the patients underwent a stereotactic brain biopsy in which the histologic findings were compatible with gliomatosis cerebri with diffuse widespread infiltration of glioma cells with no constitution of a circumscribed tumor mass. The first patient was treated with cranial radiation, chemotherapy, steroids, and combined antiepileptic therapy. The focal seizures gradually but markedly decreased in frequency, and sensory impairment abated within 18 months after establishment of the diagnosis and ensuing therapy. Cognition remains intact. The second female died 2 years after presentation despite massive chemotherapy and antiepileptic medications. Although rare, gliomatosis cerebri should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of epilepsia partialis continua in children to facilitate a rapid diagnosis and initiation of prompt treatment of this rare disorder that may respond to a concurrent effective combination of cranial radiation, chemotherapy, and antiepileptic medications.","Brain/pathology, Child, Child, Preschool, Combined Modality Therapy, Diagnosis, Differential, Electroencephalography, Encephalitis/diagnosis, Epilepsia Partialis Continua/*diagnosis/etiology, Fatal Outcome, Female, Humans, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Myoclonus/etiology, Neoplasms, Neuroepithelial/complications/*diagnosis/pathology/therapy",-1
11673017,Review of treatment options for refractory epilepsy: new medications and vagal nerve stimulation.,"Cramer JA, Ben Menachem E, French J",Epilepsy Res. 2001 Nov;47(1-2):17-25.,"PURPOSE: the choices available for patients whose partial seizures are poorly controlled include seven new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) as add-on therapy. Comparisons are needed to help physicians and patients select among the options for treatment. METHODS: we compared efficacy and adverse events of new treatments from controlled clinical trials of patients with uncontrolled partial seizures. Response rates (> or =50% decrease in partial seizures) at doses recommended in product labeling for adjunct therapy were tabulated for overall success (placebo response rate subtracted from AED response rate). Adverse events listed in product labeling were tabulated as complaint rates (placebo events subtracted from AED events). VNS trials used low dose stimulation as a pseudo-placebo. RESULTS: overall success rates fell into two general groups with ranges of 12-20% for gabapentin (GBP), lamotrigine (LTG), tiagabine (TGB), zonisamide and 27-29% for levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate (TPM). Summary Complaint Scores also fell into two general groups with ranges of -27 to -82 for GBP, levetiracetam, TGB, zonisamide and -113 to -205 for LTG, oxcarbazepine and TPM. VNS scores were in the lower or higher success and summary complaint categories depending on whether scores from the pseudo-placebo group were subtracted from the high dose group. CONCLUSIONS: these data allow comparisons among AEDs and VNS using similar data from standard types of clinical trials.","Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data, *Electric Stimulation Therapy/methods, Epilepsy/*therapy, Epilepsy, Partial, Sensory/therapy, Humans, *Vagus Nerve",-1

Adductor-release surgery to treat or prevent hip dislocation in children with spastic CP is frequently performed and is often accompanied by severe postoperative pain and spasm. A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 16 patients (mean age 4.7 years) with a mainly spastic type of CP (either diplegic or quadriplegic in distribution) was used to test the hypothesis that a significant proportion of postoperative pain is secondary to muscle spasm and, therefore, might be reduced by a preoperative chemodenervation of the target surgical muscle by intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin A (BTX/A). Compared with the placebo, BTX/A was found to be associated with a reduction in mean pain scores of 74% (P<0.003), a reduction in mean analgesic requirements of approximately 50% (P<0.005), and a reduction in mean length of hospital admission of 33% (P<0.003). It was concluded that an important component of postoperative pain in the patient population is due to muscle spasm and this can be managed effectively by preoperative injection with BTX/A. These findings may have implications for the management of pain secondary to muscle spasm in other clinical settings.","Botulinum Toxins, Type A/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/*complications/physiopathology, Child, Child, Preschool, Double-Blind Method, Female, Hip Dislocation/etiology/*prevention & control/*surgery, Humans, Male, Muscle Contraction/*drug effects, Muscle, Skeletal/*drug effects, Neuromuscular Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Pain, Postoperative/physiopathology/*prevention & control, Treatment Outcome",-1
7941956,High-pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS).,Jain KK,Acta Neurol Scand. 1994 Jul;90(1):45-50.,"High-pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) is a condition encountered in diving beyond a depth of 100 m. Manifestations include headache, tremor, myoclonus, neuropsychiatric disturbances and EEG changes. Convulsions are seen only in experimental animals. Most of the changes are reversible on surfacing but some such as memory disturbances may linger on for long periods. Excessive atmospheric pressure is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of HPNS. Neurotransmitter changes occur of which serotonin appears to be a more likely mediator because of the resemblance of HPNS to serotonin syndrome. Anesthetics and anticonvulsants have been used in experimental animals but are unsuitable for use in human divers. Breathing gas mixtures such as heliox have enabled the extension of depth of diving without HPNS. Use of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists may provide an interesting approach to prevention of HPNS.","Animals, *High Pressure Neurological Syndrome/diagnosis/etiology/physiopathology/therapy, Humans",-1

The drug of choice to control spasms is baclofen. There would appear to be no reported studies which have evaluated the psychological and emotional effect of this drug. This preliminary study investigated a number of such effects, including depression, anxiety and general mood state. First, we examined 10 subjects before and during the administration of baclofen. They were then compared to a control group of 12 subjects. A second cohort of 12 subjects taking baclofen were compared to a control group of nine subjects at a specific time after injury. Results indicated that whilst some significant differences were found, suggesting an increase in fatigue with use of baclofen, no major adverse psychological effects were noted.

Phase II clinical trials have shown marked therapeutic activity of imatinib in all evolutive phases of CML, but notably in the chronic phase, where it induces complete hematological responses in almost 100% of patients resistant or intolerant to interferon, with a major cytogenetic response rate of 60%, including 41% complete cytogenetic responses. The preliminary results of an ongoing phase III multicenter randomized study comparing imatinib with interferon plus cytarabine as first-line treatment for CML favor imatinib in terms of efficacy and safety. If confirmed with longer follow-up,these results would establish imatinib as the choice therapy for the majority of CML patients, with allogeneic transplantation being restricted as initial therapy only to younger patients with a family donor. Longer follow-up will answer some questions, such as those on long-term safety, durability of the responses, whether these will translate into a survival prolongation and the possibility of molecular responses. In addition, further information on the mechanisms involved in the primary and acquired resistance to imatinib is needed. Besides the Bcr-Abl protein, the drug is also active against other tyrosine kinases, such as Abl, the stem-cell factor receptor (c-kit) and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, whose inhibition might have potential implications for the treatment of several malignancies. In this sense, it must be pointed out that imatinib has shown a remarkable activity in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.","Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Benzamides, Biological Availability, Clinical Trials as Topic, Half-Life, Humans, Intestinal Absorption, Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/etiology, Piperazines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy, Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy, Pyrimidines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use",-1
10983739,Raloxifene: a review of its use in postmenopausal osteoporosis.,"Clemett D, Spencer CM",Drugs. 2000 Aug;60(2):379-411.,"Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that partially mimics the effects of estrogens in bone and the cardiovascular system, while functioning as an antiestrogen in endometrial and breast tissue. In randomised placebo-controlled studies involving postmenopausal women or patients with osteoporosis, raloxifene 60 to 150 mg/day was effective in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) over 12- to 36-month periods. At the 60 mg/day recommended dosage, increases of 1.6 to 3.4%, 0.9 to 2.3% and 1.0 to 1.6% were reported in lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip, respectively, versus < or =0.5% with placebo. Raloxifene 60 or 120 mg/day decreased the risk of vertebral fractures over a 36-month period in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis. Significant reductions in radiographic fracture risk versus placebo (30 and 50%) occurred regardless of whether patients had existing fractures at baseline. Although raloxifene did not affect the overall incidence of nonvertebral fractures, a reduction in the incidence of ankle fracture was reported in comparison with placebo. In postmenopausal women, raloxifene 60 mg/day significantly reduced serum levels of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol from baseline, compared with placebo. High density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were unaffected. Raloxifene 60 or 120 mg/day reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 76% during a median of 40 months' follow-up in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis and no history of breast cancer. A relative risk reduction of 90% was reported for estrogen-receptor positive invasive breast cancers; estrogen-receptor negative cancer risk was unaffected by raloxifene. Raloxifene was generally well tolerated in clinical trials at dosages up to 150 mg/day. Adverse events thought to be related to raloxifene treatment were hot flushes and leg cramps. Venous thromboembolism was the only serious adverse event thought to be related to raloxifene treatment and a relative risk of 3.1 compared with placebo treatment was reported in patients with osteoporosis. Vaginal bleeding occurred in < or =6.4% of raloxifene-treated women but was reported by 50 to 88% of those receiving estrogens or hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Raloxifene treatment was not associated with stimulatory effects on the endometrium. CONCLUSIONS: Raloxifene significantly increases BMD in postmenopausal women and reduces vertebral fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis. In clinical trials, raloxifene was generally well tolerated compared with placebo and HRT, although its propensity to cause hot flushes precludes use in women with vasomotor symptoms. In particular, the lack of stimulatory effects on the endometrium and the reduction in invasive breast cancer incidence indicate raloxifene as an attractive alternative to HRT for the management of postmenopausal osteonorosis.","Bone Remodeling/drug effects, Breast/drug effects, Endometrium/drug effects, Female, Humans, Lipids/blood, Middle Aged, Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal/*drug therapy, Quality of Life, Raloxifene/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators/*therapeutic use",-1

METHOD: Adult patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (DSM-III-R criteria) were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or clonazepam in individually adjusted doses over 3 weeks to approximate an optimal dosage, which was then maintained for an additional 3 weeks, amounting to a 6-week therapeutic phase. The daily dose range was 0.25 to 4.0 mg administered in 2 divided doses. In the following 7-week discontinuance phase, the doses were tapered gradually to cessation. RESULTS: At the therapeutic endpoint, clonazepam (N = 222) proved clinically and statistically superior to placebo (N = 216) in change in the number of panic attacks and in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and CGI-Change scores, Patient's Global Impression of Change scores, amount of fear and avoidance associated with phobic symptoms, and duration of anticipatory anxiety. The gradual tapering of clonazepam was not associated with symptoms suggestive of withdrawal syndrome. Although patients taking clonazepam experienced some clinical worsening compared with the status achieved at endpoint, particularly in terms of number of panic attacks, no deterioration was observed using their condition at baseline as point of reference. No overall evidence of rebound was found. All regimens were generally well tolerated. Somnolence was the main adverse event associated with clonazepam therapy. The percentage of patients who reported adverse events was higher in the clonazepam group than in the placebo group, as was the mean number of adverse events per patient. CONCLUSION: In this placebo-controlled trial, clonazepam was an efficacious and safe shortterm treatment of the symptoms of panic disorder. Discontinuance during and after slow tapering was well tolerated.","Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Agoraphobia/drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology, Ambulatory Care, Clonazepam/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Comorbidity, Double-Blind Method, Drug Administration Schedule, Fatigue/chemically induced, Female, GABA Modulators/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Headache/chemically induced, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Panic Disorder/*drug therapy/epidemiology/psychology, Placebos, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales/statistics & numerical data, Sleep Disorders/chemically induced, Substance Withdrawal Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology, Treatment Outcome",-1

PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen patients with epilepsy who had taken carbamazepine at least 5 months before entering the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ten blood specimens from each patient were collected at steady-state. Plasma concentration of carbamazepine was analyzed for pharmacokinetic parameters such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), mean time to reach maximum concentration (tmax), and mean AUC. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in these parameters among four brands of carbamazepine. However, when comparing the 90% CI of AUC of three generic brands with that of the proprietary brand, the AUC of two generic brands lay within a range of 80% to 120%.

We evaluated the number of patients reported with this condition and whether data support hypotheses that have been put forth regarding the cause of these lesions. METHODS: Information that was reported in the medical literature, and by Medtronic, Inc., to the United States Food and Drug Administration as of November 30, 2000, was reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-one cases were identified, including 16 from the literature and 25 that were not published previously in the literature. Because of voluntary reporting and other methodological limitations, the actual number of cases must be higher than reported. All of the patients had chronic pain. The mean duration of therapy was 24.5 months. Most masses were located in the thoracic region. Intrathecal drugs included morphine or hydromorphone, either alone or mixed with other drugs, in 39 of 41 cases. No masses were reported in patients who received baclofen as the only intrathecal medication. Thirty patients underwent surgery to relieve spinal cord or cauda equina compression. Eleven patients were nonambulatory at last follow-up, and one died of a pulmonary embolus. Surgical specimens revealed noninfectious chronic inflammation, granuloma formation, and fibrosis or necrosis. DISCUSSION: The most plausible hypothesis with regard to the cause of intrathecal catheter tip mass lesions implicates the administration of relatively high-concentration or high-dose opiate drugs or the use of drugs and admixtures that are not labeled for intrathecal use. CONCLUSION: Patients who require high-dose intraspinal opioid therapy and those who receive drugs or admixtures that are not approved for intrathecal use should be monitored closely for signs of an extra-axial mass or catheter malfunction.

At the time of pump placement, subsequent orthopedic surgery was planned in 28 patients (58%); however, only 10 (21%) underwent surgery after IBI therapy. In all 10 cases, the surgical procedure was planned at the time of initial evaluation for IBI therapy. In the remaining 18 patients, who did not subsequently undergo their planned orthopedic operation, it was believed that their lower-extremity spasticity had improved to the degree that intervention was no longer indicated. In addition, although six patients had undergone multiple orthopedic operations before their spasticity was treated, no patient required more than one operation after IBI treatment for spasticity. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that IBI for treatment of spastic CP reduces the need for subsequent orthopedic surgery for the effects of lower-extremity spasticity. In patients with spastic CP and lower-extremity contractures, spasticity should be treated before orthopedic procedures are performed.","Adolescent, Adult, Baclofen/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Cerebral Palsy/drug therapy/*surgery, Child, Child, Preschool, Contracture/drug therapy/surgery, Femur/surgery, Follow-Up Studies, GABA Agonists/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Hemiplegia/drug therapy/surgery, Humans, Infusion Pumps, Injections, Spinal, Leg/*surgery, Muscle Relaxants, Central/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/drug therapy/surgery, Muscle, Skeletal/surgery, Patient Care Planning, Quadriplegia/drug therapy/surgery, Retrospective Studies, Tendons/surgery, Treatment Outcome",-1

The incidence of some dermatomycoses is increasing, despite availability of newer and better topical and systemic treatments. Fungal remnants last months to years under the ideal conditions, allowing continued spread of infection. Mycoses treated in one area may recur because of organism travel from concomitant areas of infection. Failure of patients and physicians to recognize a fungal etiology early may lead to more extensive, severe, or difficult-to-treat infections. Finally, a patient's concurrent illnesses may play a part in susceptibility and ability to manage fungal infections. For these reasons, scientists have studied and developed newer antifungal agents with better efficacy and greater convenience in dosing. These drugs, however, still have side effects and medication interactions that may limit their use in some patients. Better efforts to educate patients and physicians alike may aid in faster recognition and treatment of dermatophytoses. More research is needed to continue to develop drugs suitable for use in a broader range of patients and diagnostic tests that may be quicker or more specific than conventional ones.","Administration, Oral, Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use, *Dermatomycoses/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology, Fungi/pathogenicity, Humans, Malassezia/pathogenicity, *Onychomycosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology, Tinea/classification/microbiology/prevention & control, *Tinea Versicolor/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology",-1

Oral antispasticity medication is minimally effective or not well tolerated in cerebral palsy. This study assessed the effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in reducing spasticity in cerebral palsy. Candidates were screened by randomized, double-blind, intrathecal injections of baclofen and placebo. Responders were defined as those who experienced an average reduction of 1.0 in the lower extremities on the Ashworth Scale for spasticity. Responders received intrathecal baclofen via the SynchroMed System and were followed for up to 43 months. Fifty-one patients completed screening and 44 entered open-label trials. Lower-extremity spasticity decreased from an average baseline score of 3.64 to 1.90 at 39 months. A decrease in upper extremity spasticity was evidenced over the same study period. Forty-two patients reported adverse events. Most common reports were hypotonia, seizures (no new onset), somnolence, and nausea or vomiting. Fifty-nine percent of the patients experienced procedural or system-related events. Spasticity in patients with cerebral palsy can be treated effectively by continuous intrathecal baclofen.

The aim of our study was to determine whether intrathecal administration of clonidine can reduce the dose of local anesthetic, and the effects of clonidine on the cardiovascular system, and on arousal level. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized study we evaluated 56 patients scheduled for minor surgical procedure (spermatic vein ligature) under unilateral spinal anesthesia with hyperbaric bupivacaine 1%. One half of patients received clonidine (105 micrograms) in addition to bupivacaine. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate were recorded baseline until 1 hour after surgery. Cardiac output, stroke volume, ejection fraction, systemic vascular resistance and left cardiac work were measured, by thoracic electric bioimpedance method, baseline until 1 hour after surgery. Sensory block, motor block and sedation level were measured at the beginning of anesthesia and for 6 hours after the end of surgery. RESULTS: In the clonidine treated group we did not observe variations of cardiovascular parameters; in the same group we did observe sensory block and motor block significantly prolonged, a higher sedation level and a significant postoperative analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the addition of clonidine to hyperbaric bupivacaine seems to be particularly useful in unilateral spinal anesthesia, exerting minimal influence on haemodynamic parameters, and guaranting a satisfactory postoperative analgesia.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*pharmacology, Adult, *Anesthesia, Spinal, Anesthetics, Local/*pharmacology, Bupivacaine/*pharmacology, Cardiovascular System/*drug effects, Clonidine/*pharmacology, Humans, Male, Prospective Studies",-1

METHODS: Twenty male subjects with a history of criminal behavior participated in experimental sessions, which measured aggressive and escape responses. Ten subjects had a history of childhood conduct disorder (CD+) and ten control subjects had no history of CD. Aggression was measured using the point subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP), which provides subjects with aggressive, escape, and monetary-reinforced response options. RESULTS: Acute doses (0.07, 0.14 and 0.28 mg/kg) of baclofen had remarkably different effects on aggressive responses among CD+ subjects relative to control subjects. Aggressive responses of CD+ subjects decreased, while aggressive responses of control subjects increased following baclofen administration. Baclofen decreased escape responses for both CD+ and control subjects. No changes in monetary-reinforced responses were observed, indicative of no central nervous system stimulation or sedation. CONCLUSIONS: The GABA-B agonist baclofen suppressed aggressive responses in subjects with a history of childhood CD, while producing the opposite effect in control subjects. These suggest a possible unique role for GABA in the regulation of aggression in CD+ population.","Adult, Aggression/*drug effects/psychology, Analysis of Variance, Baclofen/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Conduct Disorder/drug therapy/*psychology, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Escape Reaction/*drug effects/physiology, GABA Agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, *GABA-B Receptor Agonists, Humans, Male, Matched-Pair Analysis, Personality Tests, Prisoners, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Questionnaires, Reinforcement (Psychology)",-1

The 21 patients were divided into two groups: group A, 9 patients with vitamin K deficiency, and group B, 12 patients without vitamin K deficiency. The laboratory data and background factors in the two groups were compared statistically. In group A, all patients received enteral nutrition and anticonvulsants. The protein induced by vitamin K absence-II values were elevated in eight patients. Seven exhibited a bleeding tendency. Six developed vitamin K deficiency in association with infection and four were treated with antibiotics. All showed a good response to the administration of vitamin K. The patients in group A had factors such as use of antibiotics, infection, and elemental nutrition at significantly higher rates than those in group B. Data indicating nutrition factors such as body weight, caloric intake, total protein level, and hemoglobin level were not significantly different between the two groups. Severely disabled children suffer from deficiencies of various nutritional elements. However, vitamin K deficiency in severely disabled children has not been fully investigated. Infection, use of antibiotics, and elemental nutrition are risk factors for vitamin K deficiency in severely disabled children. In severely disabled children, there might be marginal vitamin K intake via enteral nutrition, so more vitamin K supplementation is necessary, especially with infection and use of antibiotics.","Adolescent, Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Child, Child, Preschool, Dietary Proteins, *Disabled Children, *Enteral Nutrition, Female, Humans, Infant, Male, Nutritional Status, Retrospective Studies, Vitamin K Deficiency/*etiology/pathology/therapy",-1

We report the results of a three-month randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study on the effects of gabapentin in the prophylaxis of patients with migraine meeting the IHS criteria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 63 patients suffering from migraine with or without aura. Patients treated their attack at home using symptomatic drugs and clinical assessment was recorded on a diary. After a washout of 8 week from any other prophylactic treatment, all patients were treated with 1200 mg/day of gabapentin; this is our therapeutic plan: 400 mg/day from 1st to 3rd day, 800 mg/day from 4th to 6th day and 1200 mg/day from 7th day. RESULTS: No patients withdrew, gabapentin was well tolerated; adverse events (somnolence, dizziness, tremor, fatigue and ataxia) generally were transient and mild to moderate in severity and in 13 patients (27%) only occurred. At the end of treatment, in such case, we reported a significative reduction of frequency and intensity of migraine in 30 patients treated with gabapentin. DISCUSSION: Our observations indicate that gabapentin is well tolerated by patients and that reduces headache frequency and use of symptomatic drugs in both groups. Gabapentin shows to have an effective therapeutic action in the prophylactic treatment of migraine.","Acetates/*therapeutic use, Adolescent, Adult, Aged, *Amines, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Double-Blind Method, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Migraine Disorders/*prevention & control, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

METHODS: Five hundred patients with FM and 152 controls (74 healthy blood donors, 26 myofascial pain patients and 52 patients with other rheumatic diseases) were studied. All had measurements of acid extracted serum IGF-I. A subset of 90 patients with FM were evaluated for clinical features that might explain low IGF-I levels. Twenty-five patients with FM underwent growth hormone (GH) provocation testing with l-dopa and clonidine. RESULTS: The mean serum IGF-I level in patients with FM was 138 +/- 56 ng/ml and in controls 215 +/- 86 ng/ml (p = 0.00000000001). Low levels of IGF-I were not due to depression, tricyclic medications, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, poor aerobic conditioning, obesity, or pain level. Patients with focal myofascial pain syndromes had normal IGF-I levels (236 +/- 68), as did most patients with other rheumatic disorders, unless they had concomitant FM. Patients with FM with initially normal levels often had a rapid decline of IGF-I over 1 to 2 years. Most patients with FM with low IGF-I levels failed to secrete GH after stimulation with clonidine and l-dopa. CONCLUSION: Many, but not all, patients with FM have low levels of IGF-I that cannot be explained by clinical associations. These results suggest that low IGF-I levels in patients with FM are a secondary phenomenon due to hypothalamic-pituitary-GH axis dysfunction.","Adult, Clonidine/administration & dosage, Dopamine Agents/administration & dosage, Female, Fibromyalgia/*metabolism, Humans, Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/*metabolism, Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*deficiency/metabolism, Levodopa/administration & dosage, Middle Aged, Rheumatic Diseases/metabolism, Sympatholytics/administration & dosage",-1

Fifteen veterans with chronic PTSD who desired to stop smoking enrolled in a 12-week double-blind evaluation of bupropion SR and placebo. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either bupropion SR or placebo. Bupropion SR was initiated at 150 mg daily for 3 or 4 days and increased to a final dose of 150 mg twice daily (300 mg daily total). Ten patients received bupropion SR and five received placebo. Nine of the patients who received bupropion SR were already being treated with at least one other psychotropic medication. One of the ten patients did not complete the study because of medication side effects. Eighty percent of patients receiving bupropion SR successfully stopped smoking by the end of week 2, and 6 (60%) of these 10 maintained smoking cessation at the study endpoint (week 12). At the 6-month follow-up, 40% of the patients (4 of 10) who received bupropion SR maintained smoking cessation. One (20%) of the five patients who received placebo stopped smoking and maintained smoking cessation at the 6-month follow-up. Bupropion SR was generally well-tolerated in combination with other psychotropic medications. Bupropion SR may be effective in helping patients who desire to quit smoking and who also have a concomitant anxiety disorder, such as PTSD.","Adult, Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Bupropion/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Delayed-Action Preparations, Double-Blind Method, Follow-Up Studies, Humans, Male, *Smoking Cessation, Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/*complications/drug therapy, Treatment Outcome",-1

Of the 32 case reports entered into the study, 22 concerned women; mean age at the time of SPI claim submission was 47 years, and the mean duration of BZD treatment was 11.7 years. The BZD dosages were in most cases within recommended therapeutic limits. Twenty-five claimants had also been using other psychotropic drugs. In 28 of the 32 cases a psychiatric syndrome in accordance with DSM-IV was present before the start of BZD treatment-in most cases an anxiety syndrome or anxious personality trait. In the other four cases no diagnosis could be given owing to paucity of information. In the 12 cases of claimants who fulfilled BZD dependence criteria at some point during treatment, withdrawal syndromes might have affected the clinical picture to some extent. Four claimants received additional post-BZD-treatment Axis I diagnoses, but in all four cases the new diagnoses were clearly related to the pre-existing symptom pattern. Thus, apart from the dependence on the drug there was no evidence of psychiatric morbidity caused by the BZDs. The symptoms reported by the claimants as evidence of BZD-induced psychiatric morbidity seem in most cases to have been a feature of pre-existing psychopathology which became more manifest after discontinuation of BZD treatment.","Adult, Anti-Anxiety Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Anxiety Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology, Benzodiazepines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Hypnotics and Sedatives/*adverse effects/therapeutic use, *Insurance Claim Review, Male, Medical Records, Mental Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology, Middle Aged, Retrospective Studies, Substance-Related Disorders/etiology/psychology, Sweden/epidemiology",-1

PBRs are present in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral tissues, and most organs in the human body. PBRs are different from the central benzodiazepine receptors (CBRs) related to the nerve cell membrane GABA(A) receptor and are thought to play several physiological and pathophysiological functions in the CNS and immune system due to their meanly localization in glial cells, the mitochondrial outer membrane of peripheral cells and blood leucocytes and to their important roles in steroidogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent research has shown that the density of PBRs is significantly increased in CNS several disorders, such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, astrocytoma, brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Recent progress in the pharmacology of PBRs is reviewed here with respect to the functions in the brain and peripheral tissues including apoptosis, immune system modulation, seizure promotion, reactions of anticonvulsants on peripheral blood cells, and adverse drug reactions (ADR) of anticonvulsants.","Animals, Central Nervous System/drug effects/immunology/*physiopathology, Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Humans, Peripheral Nerves/drug effects, Rats, Receptors, GABA-A/drug effects/*physiology",-1

Not surprisingly, the pediatric rheumatologist is frequently called to distinguish organic from functional symptoms. During the past decade, the pediatric rheumatology community has been evaluating increasing numbers of adolescents and preadolescents who experience musculoskeletal symptoms presumably as a defense against emotional stress from achievement either in academic work or in sports. To complicate the challenge further, coexistent organic and psychologic disturbance is not rare. Clearly, organic illness does not protect a patient from emotional plan, and it may be most difficult to differentiate nonorganic pain in a patient with a known organic illness. Conversely, adolescents with organic illness may use their disease for secondary gain. Fear of misdiagnosis of physical illness as psychiatric and the notion that all of the patient's complaints should be explained by a unifying diagnosis cause diagnostic error in both psychogenic illness with physical manifestations and physical illness with psychogenic symptoms.","Adolescent, Diagnosis, Differential, Humans, Musculoskeletal Diseases/diagnosis/physiopathology/*psychology, Pain/diagnosis/etiology/*psychology, Somatoform Disorders/*diagnosis",-1

In addition, nine healthy subjects were tested as controls. The modulation of the short latency soleus stretch reflex was closer to normal with baclofen compared to the recordings without baclofen, the modulation index being 74% (range: 60 - 100) with baclofen and 62% (range: 20 - 100) without baclofen, P=0.03. In healthy subjects the modulation index was 100% (range: 52 - 100). In the early swing phase the threshold of the soleus stretch reflex was significantly higher during baclofen medication being 139 deg/s (range: 63 - 302) compared with 93 deg/s (range: 37 - 187) without baclofen, P=0.004. The relation between the stretch velocity (input) and the amplitude of the stretch reflex (output) in early swing phase was unchanged being 0. 27 microVs/deg (range: 0.1 - 1.51) in patients with baclofen and 0. 24 microVs/deg (range: 0.08 - 0.79) without baclofen, P=0.25. Baclofen induced no change in input - output properties of the stretch reflex during walking compared with findings in a sitting position at matched EMG activity. There was a significant correlation between clinical spasticity score and stretch reflex threshold in the early swing phase (rho=-0.61, P=0.04) and between clinical spasticity score and the slope of the best linear fit in the early swing phase (rho=0.72, P=0.009).","Adult, Baclofen/*therapeutic use, Differential Threshold/drug effects, Electromyography, Female, Gait, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Multiple Sclerosis/*complications, Muscle Relaxants, Central/*therapeutic use, Muscle Spasticity/*drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology, Muscle, Skeletal/drug effects/*physiopathology, Reaction Time/drug effects, Reference Values, Reflex, Stretch/*drug effects, *Walking",-1

BACKGROUND: Depression can be caused, provoked or sustained by drugs prescribed for other reasons. The evidence for this statement is based on case-reports, not on investigations in relevant populations. METHOD: In the geriatric wards of three Dutch psychiatric hospitals, 195 patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of major depression (MDD) were studied. In the first week after admission the following data were recorded: age, gender, personal psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, history of stroke, use of medication and number of different medications used. Subjects using depressogenic medication were contrasted with subjects not using depressogenic medication on all variables. RESULTS: There was a significant negative relationship, adjusted for the other variables, between the use of depressogenic medication and a previous admission for depression. No other significant relationships between the use of depressogenic medication and aetiological variables were found. Patients with a first-time admission for MDD use depressogenic medication 2.44 times more often than patients with previous admissions for depression. CONCLUSION: The use of depressogenic medication is an independent and clinically relevant aetiological factor in MDD.","Aged, Depressive Disorder, Major/*chemically induced/diagnosis, *Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Female, Humans, Male, Psychiatric Status Rating Scales, Recurrence, Retrospective Studies, Severity of Illness Index",-1

A review of the literature from the period 1966-1999 on the prevalence, clinical correlates, and treatment of depression in neurologic disease revealed a female preponderance of depression in diffuse neurologic disease, including Alzheimer's disease. In focal neurologic disease, the data were consistent for men and women, with a 1:1 ratio. Treatment data on depression in neurologic disease are scant, with the exception of poststroke depression. Although gender-based outcome data on the treatment of functional depression reveal better tolerability and response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors in women than in men, this phenomenon cannot be generalized to depression in neurologic disease. Men seem to consistently respond better than premenopausal women to tricyclic antidepressants in both functional and neurologic disease.

Patients complain of burning, stinging, or itching, which is often triggered or exacerbated by psychological or physical stress. These symptoms may be manifestations of an underlying psychiatric disorder or may represent a type of chronic pain syndrome. OBSERVATIONS: Eleven women presented with chronic severe pain and/or pruritus of the scalp only without objective physical findings, a condition we term ""scalp dysesthesia."" Five women described pain, stinging, or burning only; 4 women complained of pain and pruritus; and 2 women reported pruritus only. The patients ranged in age from 36 to 70 years. The duration of symptoms ranged from 9 months to 7 years. Five women had physician-diagnosed psychiatric disorders, including dysthymic disorder, generalized anxiety, and somatization. Seven women reported that stress triggers or exacerbates their symptoms. Eight women experienced improvement or complete resolution of symptoms with treatment with low-dose doxepin hydrochloride or amitriptyline hydrochloride. One patient responded completely to treatment with sertraline and hydroxyzine hydrochloride but then experienced a relapse. CONCLUSIONS: We describe 11 patients with a new syndrome that we term scalp dysesthesia. Of 11 patients, 9 benefited from treatment with low doses of antidepressants.","Adult, Aged, Antidepressive Agents/therapeutic use, Female, Humans, Mental Disorders/complications, Middle Aged, *Paresthesia/complications/drug therapy/psychology, *Scalp, Stress, Psychological/complications",-1

Interactions involving warfarin may be thus avoidable. As many patients who have suffered from a stroke or other thromboembolic events may also develop psychiatric disorder, knowledge about possible interactions with psychotropics is essential for prescribers. METHOD: A Medline and hand search of published literature was complemented by contacting manufacturers. RESULTS: The antidepressants citalopram, nefazodone and sertraline have relatively low interaction potential with warfarin; fluoxetine and fluvoxamine relatively high. Carbamazepine appears to reduce warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Other antipsychotics, antidepressants and anxiolytics have only a theoretical risk of interaction. Lithium, gabapentin, sulpiride and amisulpride are predominantly renally excreted and so are not likely to interact with warfarin. CONCLUSION: Many psychotropics are involved in predictable interactions with warfarin. Drugs with a known low interaction potential should be chosen instead of those known or predicted to interact.","Anticoagulants/*pharmacology/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacology, Depression/*drug therapy/*etiology, Drug Interactions, Humans, Isoenzymes/drug effects, Stroke/drug therapy/psychology, Warfarin/*metabolism/therapeutic use",-1

There were 11 women and 9 men with a mean age 53 years (range: 23-78 years); 9 patients had low back and leg pain, 9 had neuropathic pain, 1 had pelvic pain and 1 Wegner's granulomatosis. Pain intensity and pain relief, as well as sensory and motor blockade, were assessed for 3 h following each injection. The combination was reported as the best pain relief by 12 of the 17 patients who completed all three arms of the study; 4 patients reported that clonidine was the best, 1 patient reported that none of the injections provided any analgesia and no patient reported that lignocaine was the best. SPID analysis revealed a significant difference between the combination and lignocaine (P < 0.05) but no other significant difference. TOTPAR analysis revealed no significant difference between any of the injections. All 3 injections produced evidence of neurological blockade; clonidine produced sensory blockade in 3 patients and motor blockade in 3 patients. Lignocaine produced sensory blockade in 6 patients and motor in 8 patients, while the combination produced evidence of neurological blockade in all 17 patients, sensory in 6 and motor in 11 patients. Overall there was no relationship between neurological blockade and analgesia. The reported side effects appeared to be related to clonidine. These data indicate that in these patients with chronic pain epidural clonidine had a supra-additive effect and behaved more like a co-analgesic than a pure analgesic.","Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic, use, Adult, Aged, *Analgesia, Epidural, Anesthetics, Local/*therapeutic use, Chronic Disease, Clonidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Double-Blind Method, Drug Combinations, Female, Humans, Lidocaine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Male, Middle Aged, Pain/*drug therapy",-1

Regardless of the underlying cause, hyperthermia increases metabolic expenditure, glutamate release, and neutrophil activity to levels higher than those occurring in the normothermic brain-injured patient. This synergism may further compromise the injured brain, enhancing the vulnerability to secondary pathogenic events, thereby exacerbating neuronal damage. Although rigorous control of normal body temperature is the current standard of care for the brain-injured patient, patient management strategies currently available are often suboptimal and may be contraindicated. This article represents a compendium of published work regarding the state of knowledge of the relationship between hyperthermia and TBI, as well as a critical examination of current management strategies.","Animals, Body Temperature Regulation/physiology, Brain/*physiopathology, Brain Injuries/*complications, Cytokines/metabolism, Fever/*etiology/*physiopathology/therapy, Fever of Unknown Origin/physiopathology, Humans, Hypothalamus/physiopathology",-1

It is mostly observed in the advanced stage of Parkinson's disease (PD), particularly in the early morning, in the evening, and late at night. Indeed, some patients have experienced OPD also during ""on"" periods when dystonic posture of the foot alternates with dyskinesia. The pain probably is due to sustained muscle contraction, which causes prolonged muscle spasm, as in primary dystonia or torticollis. Dopaminergic drugs like bromocriptine, pergolide, and especially apomorphine (s.c. infusions, or bolus), can dramatically improve the OPD. Anticholinergics baclofen and lithium are alos used in the management of OPD with some benefit. On the other hand, clinical experience shows that in many cases, these therapeutic procedures are not always enough to produce the expected results. Thirty PD patients (22 men and eight women) with OPD of the foot were treated with botulinum toxin (Botox, Btx) using electromyograms to guide injections. Dystonia was evaluated using a quantitative rating scale. The selection of the muscles for Btx treatment was carried out on the basis of foot posture. We injected Btx into tibialis posterior, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius, flexor digitorum longus, and extensores hallucis longus with a median dose 40 IU for each muscle, distributed in two sites. In all patients, the pain improved within 10 days, whereas in 21 patients, the pain disappeared completely for 4 months (range, 3-7 months); a concomitant improvement in intensity of the dystonic spasm was also observed. No side effects were reported. Seven patients with associated ""on"" foot dystonia described an improvement of foot posture on walking. In conclusion, in this uncontrolled study, the use of Btx in OPD seemed a promising tool to improve pain linked to foot dystonia; however, because of the well-known underlying dopaminergic defect in OPD, the Btx therapy should be considered only if the dopaminergic treatment established for the management of OPD has failed.","Aged, Botulinum Toxins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects, Dystonia/*chemically induced/drug therapy/physiopathology, Electromyography/drug effects, Female, Foot/innervation, Humans, Injections, Intramuscular, Levodopa/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Contraction/drug effects/physiology, Neurologic Examination/drug effects, Pain/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Parkinson Disease/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Walking",-1

We have compared secondary progressive MS patients with normal subjects (NS) and two models of autonomic dysfunction; pure autonomic failure (PAF) and multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome). There was up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in MS and PAF patients but not in MSA patients. Only in PAF patients beta-adrenoceptor up-regulation was correlated with low plasma levels of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (Ad). In addition to studies in the basal state, measurements also were made after the centrally acting sympatholytic agent clonidine. These were combined with haemodynamic and neurohormonal measurements. After clonidine, there was a fall in blood pressure in NS and MSA patients but not in MS and PAF patients; a rise in growth hormone (GH) in NS and PAF patients but not in MS and MSA patients; and an up-regulation in PBMCs beta-adrenoceptors in NS but not in MS, MSA and PAF patients. Up-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors on PBMCs in MS could be attributed to autonomic dysfunction but the disparity between MS and PAF patients when considering their plasma levels of NA and Ad argue against. Although the neurohormonal responses to clonidine and the physiological assessment of autonomic function in progressive MS patients, demonstrate central autonomic dysfunction resembling that of the MSA patients, the normal basal beta-adrenoceptor densities in the latter, suggests that the up-regulation of these receptors is independent of the central autonomic dysfunction in MS.","Adult, Aged, Autonomic Nervous System/drug effects/physiopathology, Autonomic Nervous System Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Clonidine/therapeutic use, Epinephrine/*blood, Female, Growth Hormone/blood, Hemodynamics/drug effects/physiology, Humans, Iodocyanopindolol, Male, Middle Aged, Monocytes/drug effects/*metabolism, Multiple Sclerosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/*physiopathology, Norepinephrine/*blood, Pindolol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics, Radioligand Assay, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/drug effects/*physiology, Shy-Drager Syndrome/diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology, Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology",-1

The treatment of chronic pain, a multidimensional disease, should rely on the expertise of varying health care providers and should focus not only on the neurobiological mechanisms of the process but also on the psychosocial aspects of the disease. Implantable devices are costly and invasive, and such efficacious therapies should be used only when more conservative and less costly therapies have failed to provide relief of pain and suffering. Spinal cord stimulation provides neuromodulation of neuropathic, but not nociceptive, pain signals and when used for appropriate indications in the right individuals provides approximately 60-80% long-term pain relief in 60-80% of patients trialled for efficacy. Intrathecal therapies with opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, sufentanil or meperidine--or non-opioids such as clonidine or bupivacaine--provide analgesia in patients with nociceptive or neuropathic pain syndromes.

Oxcarbazepine has the same mechanism of action as carbamazepine, whereas gabapentin's mechanism is still uncertain. The major clinical indications of these new antiepileptic drugs are represented by partial complex seizures.

12513114,"Demographics, assessment and management of pain in the elderly.","Davis MP, Srivastava M",Drugs Aging. 2003;20(1):23-57.,"The prevalence of pain increases with each decade of life. Pain in the elderly is distinctly different from pain experienced by younger individuals. Cancer is a leading cause of pain; however, other conditions that cause pain such as facet joint arthritis (causing low back pain), polymyalgia rheumatica, Paget's disease, neuropathies, peripheral vascular disease and coronary disease most commonly occur in patients over the age of 50 years. Poorly controlled pain in the elderly leads to cognitive failure, depression and mood disturbance and reduces activities of daily living. Barriers to pain management include a sense of fatalism, denial, the desire to be 'the good patient', geographical barriers and financial limitations. Aging causes physiological changes that alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of analgesics, narrowing their therapeutic index and increasing the risk of toxicity and drug-drug interactions. CNS changes lead to an increased risk of delirium. Assessment among the verbal but cognitively impaired elderly is satisfactorily accomplished with the help of unidimensional and multidimensional pain scales. A comprehensive physical examination and pain history is essential, as well as a review of cognitive function and activities of daily living. The goal of pain management among the elderly is improvement in pain and optimisation of activities of daily living, not complete eradication of pain nor the lowest possible drug dosages. Most successful management strategies combine pharmacological and nonpharmacological (home remedies, massage, topical agents, heat and cold packs and informal cognitive strategies) therapies. A basic principle of the pharmacological approach in the elderly is to start analgesics at low dosages and titrate slowly. The WHO's three-step guideline to pain management should guide prescribing. Opioid choices necessitate an understanding of pharmacology to ensure safe administration in end-organ failure and avoidance of drug interactions. Adjuvant analgesics are used to reduce opioid adverse effects or improve poorly controlled pain. Adjuvant analgesics (NSAIDs, tricyclic antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs) are initiated prior to opioids for nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Preferred adjuvants for nociceptive pain are short-acting paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors and corticosteroids (short-term). Preferred drugs for neuropathic pain include desipramine, nortriptyline, gabapentin and valproic acid. Drugs to avoid are pentazocine, pethidine (meperidine), dextropropoxyphene and opioids that are both an agonist and antagonist, ketorolac, indomethacin, piroxicam, mefenamic acid, amitriptyline and doxepin. The type of pain, and renal and hepatic function, alter the preferred adjuvant and opioid choices. Selection of the appropriate analgesics is also influenced by versatility, polypharmacy, severity and type of pain, drug availability, associated symptoms and cost.","Acetaminophen/therapeutic use, Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use, Aged, Analgesics/*therapeutic use, Analgesics, Opioid/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use, Bone Resorption/prevention & control, Demography, Geriatric Assessment, Humans, Pain/drug therapy/*etiology, *Pain Management, Pain Measurement, Pain, Intractable/drug therapy, Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy",-1

We report a case of new-onset complex motor and vocal tics that began after hemorrhage of an arteriovenous malformation located in the left frontal lobe. We have found no reported cases of new-onset tics related to arteriovenous malformations or hemorrhage into the frontal lobes. The patient is a 16-year-old right-hand-dominant boy who presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Evaluation, including magnetic resonance imaging, revealed a left frontal arteriovenous malformation, confirmed by angiogram. Following resection, there was an intraparenchymal hemorrhage of the left frontal lobe with intraventricular hemorrhage, noted most prominently in the left lateral and IIIrd ventricles, and a subdural hematoma caudal to the craniotomy. The postoperative course was complicated by hemiparesis and global aphasia. During recovery, the patient developed what was thought to be a complex partial seizure evidenced by head turning to the right with vocalization and left upper extremity clonic jerks. These were brief and occurred multiple times per day. A trial of carbamazepine was given with no improvement. It was noted that the spells occurred more frequently under stress, as when the patient was frustrated with communication. The diagnosis was changed to complex motor tics and the therapy changed to clonidine. The tics subsequently improved by 80%, although they were still present. We believe the development of complex motor tics due to frontal hemorrhage represents a unique etiology and could complicate postsurgical recovery in similar cases.","Acute Disease, Adolescent, Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/*therapeutic use, Cerebral Hemorrhage/*complications/etiology, Clonidine/*therapeutic use, Craniotomy/*adverse effects, Diagnosis, Differential, Epilepsy, Tonic-Clonic/diagnosis/etiology, Frontal Lobe/*pathology/surgery, Hematoma, Subdural/etiology, Humans, Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformations/*surgery, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Male, Tic Disorders/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology, Treatment Outcome",-1

Such excitotoxic cell death involves excessive calcium influx and release from internal organelles, oxyradical production, and engagement of programmed cell death (apoptosis) cascades. Apoptotic proteins such as p53, Bax, and Par-4 induce mitochondrial membrane permeability changes resulting in the release of cytochrome c and the activation of proteases, such as caspase-3. Events occurring at several subcellular sites, including the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and nucleus play important roles in excitotoxicity. Excitotoxic cascades are initiated in postsynaptic dendrites and may either cause local degeneration or plasticity of those synapses, or may propagate the signals to the cell body resulting in cell death. Cells possess an array of antiexcitotoxic mechanisms including neurotrophic signaling pathways, intrinsic stress-response pathways, and survival proteins such as protein chaperones, calcium-binding proteins, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Considerable evidence supports roles for excitotoxicity in acute disorders such as epileptic seizures, stroke and traumatic brain and spinal cord injury, as well as in chronic age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A better understanding of the excitotoxic process is not only leading to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative disorders, but also to unexpected insight into mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.","Animals, Cell Death/drug effects/*physiology, Cell Survival/drug effects/*physiology, Central Nervous System/drug effects/*metabolism/physiopathology, Humans, Neurodegenerative Diseases/drug therapy/*physiopathology/prevention & control, Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology, Neurotoxins/*pharmacology, Oxidative Stress/drug effects/physiology, Receptors, Glutamate/drug effects/*metabolism, Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology",-1

Most patients benefit from some form of medical therapy, guided by the three-step World Health Organization analgesic ladder. Opioid therapy is appropriate when needed for low back pain, especially in the acute period. Adjuvant medication (eg, an anticonvulsant or antidepressant) may help reduce or eliminate the need for opioid therapy. Side effects are common with opioid medications, although many resolve with time. Patient education in exercise, back protection, nutrition, and sexual concerns is an important component of treatment. Some patients may benefit from referral to a pain center for multidisciplinary management. Those with a structural or mechanical cause of pain may do well with surgery.","Adult, Age Factors, Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Anticonvulsants/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Drug Therapy, Combination, Humans, Low Back Pain/*drug therapy/etiology/surgery, Patient Education as Topic",-1

To evaluate its efficacy in treating muscle cramping syndromes, we studied clinical and neurophysiological variables before and after botulinum toxin injections into calf muscles and small flexor muscles of the foot in patients with an inherited benign cramp-fasciculation syndrome. At each assessment the clinical severity of cramp was scored and the cramp threshold frequency was measured with repetitive electrical peripheral nerve stimulation. Botulinum toxin injection significantly lowered our patients' clinical cramp severity scores (mean +/- SD: before, 3.80 +/- 0.44; after, 1.40 +/- 0.54), left muscle strength unchanged and significantly increased their cramp threshold frequencies (before, 4.22 +/- 2.26 Hz; after, 10.0 +/- 3.74 Hz). The clinical benefit induced by botulinum toxin lasted about 3 months. Botulinum toxin injections also significantly reduced fasciculation potentials in relaxed muscles (before, 0.86 +/- 0.19 fasciculations/sec; after, 0.45 +/- 0.11 fasciculations/sec). These findings show that local intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin provide effective, safe, and long-lasting relief of cramps possibly by reducing presynaptic cholinergic stimulation of motor nerve terminals and by impairing the input/output function of intrafusal and extrafusal motor end plates.","Adult, Aged, Botulinum Toxins/*therapeutic use, Electromyography, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*drug therapy/physiopathology, Prognosis",-1

We investigated the cause of a cluster of severe neurologic complications in patients with intrathecal catheters. METHODS: We performed an epidemiologic cohort study of patients who had intrathecal catheters in place in one neurosurgical practice, to assess the presence of new neurologic complications and associated risk factors. RESULTS: The practice included 61 patients who received pain medication through implanted intrathecal catheter pumps, 19 of whom were treated with morphine, either alone or in combination with other medications. None of the 42 patients whose drug regimen did not include morphine developed a complication, whereas 8 of 13 patients who received morphine in refills of their pumps during one 4-week period experienced neurologic complications. Three persons underwent laminectomy for sterile abscesses and were left with new paralysis or leg weakness. Testing of two stock bottles from the involved pharmacy, both labeled as containing pure morphine, revealed the presence of methadone in addition to morphine. One of these bottles also contained trace ethanol. A sample of medication aspirated from the pump of a patient prescribed morphine from the same pharmacy was also found to have contained methadone and methanol. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of severe neurologic complications was associated with inadvertent administration of methadone, and perhaps other unintended substances, by means of implanted intrathecal catheters to a group of patients. Medical errors in an outpatient pharmacy led to this outbreak.","Adult, Aged, Analgesics, Opioid/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Catheters, Indwelling, Cluster Analysis, Cohort Studies, Disease Outbreaks, Drug Compounding, *Drug Contamination, Epidural Abscess/epidemiology/*etiology, Ethanol, Female, Humans, *Infusion Pumps, Implantable, Injections, Spinal, Male, *Medication Errors, Methadone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects, Methanol, Middle Aged, Morphine/*administration & dosage, Pain/drug therapy, Paralysis/epidemiology/*etiology, Pharmacy, Risk Factors, Tennessee/epidemiology",-1
11701260,Epidemiology of West syndrome in Singapore.,"Lee WL, Ong HT",Brain Dev. 2001 Nov;23(7):584-5.,"The incidence of West syndrome (WS) was determined by a search of reports of electroencephalograms (EEG) recorded in 1998 and 1999 in all public hospitals in Singapore. Amongst records of patients born in 1998, nine were found with EEG features of hypsarrhythmia or modified hypsarrhythmia with onset of seizures between January 1,1998 and December 31, 1999. The medical records of these patients were reviewed. The population of children born in 1998 was 43,664. In 1998 and 1999, 67% of all hospital admissions for patients 2 years or younger in Singapore were in public hospitals. The cumulative incidence of WS in Singapore corrected for the percentage of hospital admissions to public hospitals was 3.1/10,000 live births. The corrected cumulative incidences in Chinese, Malays and Indians were 2.7, 3.1 and 3.3 per 10,000, respectively. Three cases were idiopathic; three were due to congenital structural lesions of the brain; one each had periventricular leucomalacia, intracranial hemorrhage and severe intrauterine growth retardation. None of the patients were normal at follow up. The three patients with idiopathic WS had mild global developmental delay and the other six cases had cerebral palsy and severe mental retardation. With the best modern medical treatment, possibly only two of the nine cases of WS may have been prevented.","Asian Continental Ancestry Group, Humans, Incidence, India/ethnology, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Malaysia/ethnology, Retrospective Studies, Singapore/epidemiology, Spasms, Infantile/*epidemiology",-1

Although there are many known causes--endocrinologic, neurologic, and vascular disorders, treatment with certain drugs, and occupational factors--a significant portion of cases are idiopathic. History, physical exam, and laboratory testing can provide clues for distinguishing between cramps with identifiable causes and idiopathic cases. For nonidiopathic cases, management consists of treating the underlying cause whenever possible. A nonpharmacologic approach (massaging and stretching) is the recommended first-line treatment for idiopathic cases. Quinine sulfate also appears to offer safe and effective symptom management of idiopathic cases, although its efficacy has not been definitively established in clinical trials.","Age Distribution, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Exercise, Female, Humans, Incidence, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle Cramp/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*therapy, Prognosis, Quinine/administration & dosage, Risk Factors, Severity of Illness Index, Sex Distribution",-1

Clinical pharmacology of moxonidine and rilmenidine.,"Van Zwieten PA, Peters SL",Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1999 Jun 21;881:420-9.,"Moxonidine and rilmenidine are moderately selective I1-receptor stimulants. The imidazoline (I1) agonists cause peripheral sympathoinhibition, triggered at the level of central nervous imidazoline receptors. Imidazoline receptor stimulants are effective antihypertensive agents with a hemodynamic profile that is attractive from a pathophysiologic point of view. The antihypertensive activity of these agents is caused by vasodilatation and reduced peripheral vascular resistance. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume is reduced, whereas heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and pulmonary artery pressures are largely unchanged. Long-term left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced. Both drugs, when applied in a once-daily dosage schedule, appear to control hypertension in most patients. Both drugs have been compared with representative agents from the major classes of antihypertensive drugs in controlled trials and found to be equally effective in blood pressure control. The incidence and severity of side effects are lower than those for clonidine, particularly with respect to sedation. A rebound (withdrawal) phenomenon has so far not been reported for moxonidine and rilmenidine. Therefore, I1-receptor stimulants offer the possibility of developing centrally acting agents with a better side-effect profile than do the classic alpha 2-adrenoceptor stimulants.","Animals, Antihypertensive Agents/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Brain/drug effects/physiology, Clinical Trials as Topic, Clonidine/adverse effects/therapeutic use, Hemodynamics/*drug effects, Humans, Hypertension/*drug therapy, Imidazoles/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Imidazoline Receptors, Oxazoles/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use, Receptors, Drug/*agonists",-1
11783808,Gabapentin for neuropathic pain: systematic review of controlled and uncontrolled literature.,"Mellegers MA, Furlan AD, Mailis A",Clin J Pain. 2001 Dec;17(4):284-95.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy/effectiveness and side effects of gabapentin for the treatment of neuropathic pain. DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. METHODS: Extensive search of several electronic databases located both controlled and uncontrolled studies. Efficacy was assessed through meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), whereas the effectiveness of gabapentin in uncontrolled studies was assessed via a novel system of dichotomous classification of ""bad"" versus ""good"" results. FINDINGS: Thirty-five papers involving 727 patients with multiple neuropathic pain conditions met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis of the 2 high-quality, placebo-controlled RCTs showed positive effect of gabapentin in diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia. The addition of 2 low-quality, placebo-controlled RCTs did not alter the magnitude or direction of observed effect. The uncontrolled studies demonstrated positive effect on pain in different neuropathic syndromes, as well as benefit on different types of neuropathic pain; highest dose administered and rate-of-dose escalation showed wide variability between prescribers. Fewer and less severe side effects were reported in the uncontrolled studies. CONCLUSIONS: Gabapentin seems to be effective in multiple painful neuropathic conditions. The variable prescribing patterns of the uncontrolled studies raise the suspicion that effectiveness may be reduced if one limits administration of the drug to very low doses, whereas rapid dose escalation may be associated with increased central nervous system side effects. Well-designed controlled trials may provide insight into differential symptom sensitivity to the drug.","Acetates/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, *Amines, Analgesics/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use, Clinical Trials as Topic, *Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Humans, Neuralgia/*drug therapy, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Treatment Outcome, *gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",-1

METHODOLOGY: The database of children seen in the Epilepsy Clinic of Queen Mary Hospital and Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital during a 30-year period (1970-2000) was reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 105 cases had WS (1.9%). The number of new cases of WS admitted per year ranged from one to eight. The range of annual incidence of WS to newly diagnosed epilepsy was 0.8-4.8%. The etiology included idiopathic (N=19, 18%), cryptogenic (N=23; 22%), symptomatic (N=56; 53.3%) and unknown (N=7; 5.7%). Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and/or prednisone were given to 42 children (40%). Most were effective in controlling WS on an all-or-none fashion. Seizure outcome included 12 with remission, persistent in the same form in two and persisting but changed to another form in the rest. Neurological outcome at the last follow up in 2000 December included multiple disabilities (N=16), cerebral palsy (N=22), mental retardation (N=94) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (N=13). We analysed the following risk factors in relation to poor outcome: age of onset, age of presentation, time lag before treatment, etiology, family history of epilepsy and hormonal treatment. Only etiology of WS has a positive correlation with poor outcome (P<0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: WS is an uncommon epileptic syndrome. The majority had poor outcome, especially those with causes identified. Infantile spasm is a specific epileptic phenomenon in a maturational stage of a child when heterogeneous disorders can present with the same clinical epileptic and electroencephalographic phenomenon.","Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use, Child, Hospitalized/*statistics & numerical data, Child, Preschool, Female, Hong Kong/epidemiology, Humans, Incidence, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Prognosis, Risk Factors, Spasms, Infantile/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology, Treatment Outcome, Vigabatrin/therapeutic use",-1
